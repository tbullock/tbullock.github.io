    <link href="http://tbullock.github.io/blog/2009/05/21/nokia-6301-and-linux-part-2/"/>

    <id>http://tbullock.github.io/blog/2009/05/21/nokia-6301-and-linux-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I noticed that I have a couple of dozen visitors hit my earlier posting on synchronizing linux systems with a nokia 6301, and given that I am on a bit of high after just posting my previous note about connecting to the net through the the GPRS and bluetooth functions on the nokia 6301 I figure I will follow with my latest discoveries fiddling fun.<br /><br />I must be turning into a google zealot because everytime I turn around there is another google service available which I want to twiddle.  Let me explain.<br /><br />Currently Evolution does not support synchronizing itself in any sane fashion against a syncml device like the nokia 6301.  So all my contacts living inside my client have become increasingly disconnected with the contacts listed with gmail and the contacts that I have on my cell phone.<br /><br />Obviously the context between these three application is somewhat different in each case.  Like I often want to be able to grab a map of my next intended target from the evolution address book, but rarely want to do this inside of gmail itself, and I usually cannot be bothered with any of that rigamarole on the cell phone.  Nevertheless, it would still be nice if they were synchronized.<br /><br />So here steps in google to the rescue with its online syncml service, along with <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/">instructions on how to configure</a> the sister device of the 6301 (6300 in this case) to use its service.  Note that the Nokia 6301 and 6300 are S40 series Symbian OS devices.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t go into the details of the configuration since they are adequately specified elsewhere, but figure I will get to the point, thanks google for providing a working sync service.<br /><br />Next I want to point out that gmail is available as a binary application on most recent nokia phones including the slightly older models such as the 6301.  As a side note, this works with Google Apps as well.<br /><br />Check out http://m.google.com for all the goodies, including google maps.<br /><br />Sigh, I can feel the tendrils of zealotness swirling around me&#8230;  Somebody kick me if I go too far.<br /><br />Anyways, while this isn&#8217;t exactly a Nokia 6301 and Linux article, the same results can be achieved, so I figure it is a good enough equivalent.</div>

Currently I am sitting in Austin&#8217;s Neighborhood Pub across the street from my little condominium here in Calgary, Alberta.  Although I can see a number of wireless networks in the area, none of them are unsecured and for their own reasons, the pub itself is not particularly interested in providing wireless connectivity to its patrons.<br /><br />So this leaves me with the need to be creative in how I connect to the internet.  What&#8217;s more, in a couple weeks I am leaving for my second major cross country bicycle tour of Canada, and will likely be more or less completely away from the gentle caress of the net for most of that time.<br /><br />Anyways, as I mentioned, I need to be creative with this whole connectivity thing, and my solution is via bluetooth, to route packets through my cell phone and connect to the net via the phones GPRS (and EGPRS in some areas) data connection.<br /><br />The thing that impressed me is that this technology is alreadly quite nicely supported in linux, albeit with a bit of work on the commandline (not much, just check out pand, bnep, and of course ifconfig and dhclient).  If you want some fairly superb documentation on this check out the bluetooth article gentoo wiki.<br /><br />I imagine that other operating systems like the BSD&#8217;s would support this as well, but I haven&#8217;t confirmed it.<br /><br />Congrats to the bluez folks for delivering a working network bluetooth stack for linux.<br /><br />As a side note from what I read on <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/dcbw/category/networkmanager/">Dan Williams&#8217; Blog</a>, this functionality will eventually make its way into network manager itself sometime around the release of 0.8.<br /><br />This makes me want to move to a phone that actually supports 3g data connections to make this all a bit faster than dialup&#8230; However, at this time there is nothing available on the market which will do everything I want from a phone (3G. UMA, Bluetooth and supports a native binary gmail application). My current Nokia 6301 does all of this except the 3G thing, so I am going to stick with it for the time being.<br /><br />Take Care, and hopefully I will post back here before I leave for my tour, but then again, even if I don&#8217;t then so be it, I will be able to post from the road.<br /><br />Please enjoy responsibly</div>

My friend Tristan and I have been fans of Master of Orion 2 for well over a decade at this point.  Personally, the game is within my top three all time favorite games (also including Crusaders of the Dark Savant and Close Combat 2).<br /><br />Anyways, a long time ago, we discovered that network multiplayer of MOO2 was deeply slow and sucky (like impossible to play for a protracted period of time).  The games we have played against one another have either been hotseat or deeply time consuming and resulting in no real conclusion.<br /><br />Well, no more.  I finally got off my butt in regards to this issue this week and managed to get MOO2 running quite nicely in Dosbox.  This resulted in us spending about 19 hours over the course of the last weekend playing the game the way it was meant to be played (to the bitter end of course, and several times over to boot)!<br /><br />Anywho, this worked so well, that I am currently writing an NSIS installer which will pull all the necessary components off of the install CD, as well as properly configure DOSBOX such that nobody else needs to go through the decade long pain in the ass that we went through ever again.<br /><br />Basically, what I have so far asks for the path to the install CD, copies the DOS only files to the HD, patches the game and sets up a local copy of dosbox to run it.<br /><br />Later I will write a launcher which will get the dosbox environment running in some sort of sanitized location and execute various cli switches to configure the gameplay itself.<br /><br />Weee!<br /><br />-Ted</div>

I have wanted to be part of an open source software development business for a long time.  Ha.  I&#8217;m quite giddy right now, because I just happen to own one.<br /><br />I have a number of little development contracts out right now to develop a variety of tools, website extensions and generally muck about with technology.  What&#8217;s really cool is that I am using exclusively open source tools and environments to do the work in.<br /><br />Ha, this great.<br /><br />So long, and later.</div>
