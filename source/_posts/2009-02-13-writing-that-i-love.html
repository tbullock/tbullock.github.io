I was just reading "Last Chance to See" by Douglas Adams.  Like most of his work, his writing once again proves to move almost orthogonally to the normal train of thought.<br /><br />For instance,<br /><br /><blockquote>Virtually everything we were told in Indonesia turned out not to be true, sometimes almost immediately.  The only exception to this was when we were told that something would happen immediately, in which case it turned out not to be true over an extended period of time.</blockquote><br /><br />RIP Douglas, you're still in my heart.</div>
