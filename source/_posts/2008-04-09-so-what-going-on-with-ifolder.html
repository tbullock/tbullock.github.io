The <a href="http://www.ifolder.com">ifolder</a> project is a really interesting way of synchronizing data between users and locations.  I personally used the project for over a year against SuSE Linux 10.1.<br /><br />Back in 2006 I filed an <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=232984">enhancement request</a> for openSUSE 10.3 to include the open source ifolder server with the distribution.  There was fair degree of interest on the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2006-12/msg00403.html">mailing list</a>.<br /><br />To date, there has been no action by Novell to include this software with their open source distribution.  This is interesting because <span style="font-style:italic;">they wrote it in the first place</span>.  If I were a conspiracy theorist, I would think that they are holding it back from the open source community just so that their enterprise distribution (OES for example) would be more value added than their community distribution.<br /><br />Lucky thing I could care less about conspiracy theories.<br /><br />So Novell has not put more than a token response into this request since the original request was made. Indeed I have just spent the day on IRC (#openSUSE-factory) waiting for a response to this question.<br /><br />I'll try to be on their next status meeting to pursue this further.</div>
