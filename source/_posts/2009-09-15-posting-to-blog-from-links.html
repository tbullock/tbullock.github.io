Well, here is the first time that I have done anything like this.  The latest milestone from OpenSUSE is broken.  Apparently they patched HAL with a crummy patch or something and now when you boot the OS hal crashes and you cannot access your mouse or keyboard while X is running....<br /><br />Not the slickest thing that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Anyways, I booted to the commandline rather than start X and am posting this comment from the links browser.<br /><br />I couldn't tell you if I like the experience, but it is definitely a first for me.<br /><br />Anyways, this is not meant to be a profound or indeed informative post, I just wanted to see if I could actually do it from the commandline line in text mode, and it turns out that I can.<br /><br />Now I am going to go to bed just because it is that time of day.<br /><br />So long.<br /><br />Ted</div>
