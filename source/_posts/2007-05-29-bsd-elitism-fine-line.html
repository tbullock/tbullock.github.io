The entire concept behind the *BSD OS's are awesome.  Free for any purpose.  It's great.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these systems are built and used by people.  And as usually is the case when people get involved, a certain number of zealots creep out of the woodwork.<br /><br />These zealot people (zel-people) have the irritating habit of walking over other peoples ideas, thoughts, and perspectives.  This bugs me a lot; thus, this blog post.<br /><br />I just finished reading the following commentary about the experience that Beranger had in using the FreeBSD operating system: <a href="http://www.beranger.org/index.php?page=bsd&2007/05/28/06/50/05-taking-a-very-long-huge-break-">Taking a very long, huge break...</a>.<br /><br />I personally very much sympathize with the author of that little article/rant.<br /><br />Anyways, without going into to a long justification of how my perspective is right and those other people are wrong, I'll finish up with a few thoughts that I sometimes try to live by.<br /><br /><ul><li>I distrust anyone who feels strongly about anything.  I feel very strongly about this.</li><li>People are a problem</li></ul></div>
