<div class='post'>
Autoconf 2.62 has now been released.<br /><br />I have been anticipating this release for more than a year now due to its support for openmp and a number of C99 compiler check enhancements.<br /><br />This will be the last autoconf release under the GPL version 2; going forward we'll be seeing GPL version 3.<br /><br />Spiffy.</div>
