I was recently passed a link as to <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Opensuse_10.3" title="Wiki page on mythTV setup instructions for OpenSUSE 10.3">how to install mythtv on OpenSUSE 10.3</a>.  As I migrate from my current SUSE Linux 10.1 setup to a shiny new 10.3 installation I will be submitting contributions to that page.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I had better migrate to the schedules direct tv listing service pretty quickly here because I only have scheduling information left for 3 more days... eep!<br /><br />-Ted</div>
