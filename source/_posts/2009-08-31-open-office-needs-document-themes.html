I just spent a few minutes looking over the latest OpenOffice.org pile of poop included with opensuse 11.2 M6.  My goodness, this is a poorly thought out user interface design.  The application I am talking about particularly is writer.<br /><br />So I want to make a nice looking document with a decent title page and some nicely coloured headings all laid out with matching font choices.  I do not want to spend more than a minute or two thinking about these things either.  Please just make this the default.  I have to say I deeply prefer using the latest microsoft office compared to openoffice.  Document themes is a brilliant feature of office 2007 and it takes away the vast majority of mucking around that I have done with open office.<br /><br />To make a document in open office look pretty this the primary styles dialogue that you are given to work with:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_UwRf8HWneCo/SpuDzlFQttI/AAAAAAAAABY/5kHzWuKoo64/s1600-h/styles-and-formatting.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 261px; height: 400px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_UwRf8HWneCo/SpuDzlFQttI/AAAAAAAAABY/5kHzWuKoo64/s400/styles-and-formatting.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5376035502347564754" /></a><br /><br />Like seriously, what the hell is this.  What the hell am I supposed to do here?  Why am I shown this window, I can't do a freaking thing with it?<br /><br />So I double click on the the first thing that jumps at me in the list, nothing happens... hmmm ok, so I right click on it and I am presented with a deeply useful menu saying two things<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>new...</li><br /><li>modify...</li><br /></ul><br /><br />I can figure out the "modify..." item, it probably modifies what ever the default is, but what the hell does new... mean?  Why are there trailing dots?  If I click new... does it make a new default?<br /><br />Anyways, I don't want new things, I just want a pretty document, so I click modify with the hopes of encountering a switch somewhere which says enable pretty document.  No such luck.  I am presented with a second almost utterly useless window.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UwRf8HWneCo/SpuFuiohxkI/AAAAAAAAABg/moH2n1ZP5PU/s1600-h/paragraph-style.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 288px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UwRf8HWneCo/SpuFuiohxkI/AAAAAAAAABg/moH2n1ZP5PU/s400/paragraph-style.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5376037614814086722" /></a><br /><br />Now seriously, what the hell am I looking at here?  Look at all those damn tabs up there!<br /><br />Moral of the story is I really don't like to use open office, it is effectively a poor clone of an older microsoft office in the ui realm.  Am I a microsoft guy? No. Have I hunted for things in their new ribbon layout thing? yes.  Their office suite does what I need of it and makes an honest attempt to get out of my way.</div>
