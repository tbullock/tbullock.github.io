In reviewing some of the old yahoo/microsoft news clips of the past several months, I came across this note about <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/microsoft-yahoo-buyout,news-595.html">yahoo shareholders suing yahoo</a> for rejecting the initial Microsoft buyout deal.<br /><br />My thought is these guys are out of there minds if they think a Microsoft acquisition of Yahoo is good for them.<br /><br />I simply cannot see Microsoft being capable of stewarding a transition of this type in a way that would actually work.  Nevermind the completely divergent technology base and skill base.  If Microsoft feels they are not able to develop their Live platform to rule the day on it own, why should anyone trust them to steward the integration of a completely different platform?<br /><br />It's not that I am against Microsoft here.  AND, I don't get that they know what is missing with their own strategy to begin with. <br /><br />So I wonder what the Michigan’s Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System thinks they will get out of the Yahoo/Microsoft deal.</div>
