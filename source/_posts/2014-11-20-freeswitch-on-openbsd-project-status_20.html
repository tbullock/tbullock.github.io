Freeswitch is building and running! Not in a very stable fashion mind you!<br /><br />I'm pleased that a lot of the setup work to build the software is functional now to the point that I can actually start stabilizing the program. Notably, most of the modules that I care about for my use case are now compiled and loading succesfully.<br /><br />Still do do... well there is lots to do, mostly revolving around stabilizing for the time being.<br /><br />First bug I've hit is when I try and register a extension, the daemon is segfaulting shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Time for more fun :)</div>
