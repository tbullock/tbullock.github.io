Over the past several days, I have been working to rearrange how the comlore.com domain is organized.<br /><br />Originally, I purchased the domain as part of a web development business that I was running around 1999/2000, however, it sat at a pretty basic level for the majority of five years.<br /><br />There are a couple sites running on this domain, and traditionally they have just been subdirectories such as /bike, /httperf and /resurgence.  However, in pursuit of my new career as a freelance software engineer, I have restructured the domain.<br /><br /><ul><li>My cross canada bike website is located at http://bike.comlore.com</li><li>My httperf portal is located at http://httperf.comlore.com</li><li>This blog has moved to http://tbullock.comlore.com</li><li>Resurgence has been purged.</li><li>The root directory will be headquarters for the new business<br /></li></ul><br />A soon to be re-launched project about designing open source home theatres will be available at http://createyourhometheatre.comlore.com in the coming weeks.</div>
