The glitzy look of the recent <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.jspa">IBM Lotus Symphony</a> release got my attention pretty quickly.  While trying it out on a couple of tasks I rather rapidly started hitting various bugs.  That said, I think the OpenOffice folks could take some hints in usability from this project.<br /><br />The biggest issue that I ran into was with Bold, or Heading text not showing up on a page.  Technically the the word processor thinks that the text is there because I can move my cursor through it, however it just shows up as white.  Closing and re-opening the document will show the text for a few moments, but it will disappear again pretty quickly.<br /><br />This is a deal breaker for me.  So I won't be recommending it to anyone for the time being.  Too bad really.</div>
