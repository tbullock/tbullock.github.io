<div class='post'>
The more experience that I have with how engineering and electrical design is done, more I am astonished at how much effort goes into problems that are fundamentally trivial.<br /><br />For instance, when designing a schematic, I need to spend a considerable amount of time figuring out which terminal block contacts are available, and whether or not the final wiring layout is electrically consistent with the schematic.<br /><br />I don't care about that!<br /><br />No kidding.<br /><br />I cannot believe that I need to do that in this day and age.  I should be able to plug device one into device two and my design software should just know how to make it happen.  Period.<br /><br />At the end of the day I want to be able to say to my machine<br /><br /><blockquote>"Connect these devices in this order"</blockquote><br /><br />I should be able to just figure out basic system layout, and all the wiring, schematics and general fiddling should be just figured out for me.</div>
