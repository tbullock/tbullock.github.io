<div class='post'>
So here at the new job with Rising Edge Engineering, I have been learning all about electrical drafting, document control and the meaning of life.<br /><br />One of things that I see that is missing in the open source universe is suitable open source drafting software.  Inkscape, and OpenOffice.org Draw are not designed for this stuff.  So is there anything out there that can be used for something resembling real drafting...?<br /><br />The other thing I see is missing is some sort of document control server that OO.o, inkscape, and other document apps can plug into to deal with revisions.  It would be great to set up something that sits on top of ssh that is designed to deal with the various intricacies of document management stuff.<br /><br />Really I want an end-to-end enterprise document creation/storage system.<br /><br />Any Takers?</div>
