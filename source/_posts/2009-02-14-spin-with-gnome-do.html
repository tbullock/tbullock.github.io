As the title of the post indicates, I have been playing around with the gnome-do tool.  And so far I really do like it.<br /><br />For those people who aren't familiar with the tool, it's an application (written in mono I believe) with which translate fairly simple commands into a useful result.<br /><br />For instance, when I summon the gnome-do program and type tristan, I can either choose to start a chat with him or send an email.<br /><br />I especially like how I don't particularly need to take my hands off the keyboard in order to do something on the graphical screen.<br /><br />So I removed the gnome menu from my desktop and will give "do" a whirl for the next month or so.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
