<div class='post'>
So I am just sitting down for dinner in a local pizzeria with great expectations of enjoying a very scrumptious dinner for one.<br /><br />Being a complete nerd, I naturally have my laptop with me, and have connected to the restaurants wireless connection.  The fact that this situation is possible, really speaks to our ability to be communication.  Like really.<br /><br />Even 5 years ago, what I am doing right now, would have been relatively rare.  Now, however I am only one of several people in the restaurant playing with various wireless devices.<br /><br />Cool hey!<br /><br />Anyways, I just left my favorite computer store here in Calgary with three rather sexy video cards.<br /><br />The cards are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>PNY Low-Profile Quadro NVS 280 AGP with DMS-59 (Dual DVI-I)</li><br /><li>PNY Quadro NVS 280 PCIe with DMS-59</li><br /><li>Matrox G550 with DMS-59</li><br /></ul><br /><br />All the cards are passively cooled, and will find loving homes in the various re-incarnated computers that pass through my life.</div>
