Ok,<br /><br />So this evening I finally to the time to complete the migration of my google apps account and the google account for my address (by far the most challenging migration in my entire company.... Sheesh)<br /><br />Anyway, this means that I can once again post to my blog!<br /><br />I've been pleasantly surprised by the new blogger interface which seems fun and cozy in tune with the facelift work that Google has been performing across all its services.</div>
