I find that I get distracted from the task at hand very easily.<br /><br />My latest distraction from the FreeSWITCH on OpenBSD project has been a renewed interest in UltraSPARC hardware. I recently purchased a pair of Sun Fire V215 servers to act as routers, and on the way I got interested in the newer generations of UltraSPARC processors, which I think are very interesting for a variety of workloads that I have to deal with.<br /><br />Anyway, this evening while out at my parents place I rummaged in the basement for a few minutes trying to find an old system I had left out here a few years ago.<br /><br />Sure enough, sitting under a small pile of dust, I discovered my old Sun Blade 100 workstation. I had purchased the machine some years ago when I was working on a project which I wanted to ensure ran on big-endian architectures.<br /><br />Plugging in the system, I was pleased to discover everything was exactly as I had left it (apparently in 2007 since it still had a OpenBSD 4.1 install disk inside it).<br /><br />Quickly burning a copy of OpenBSD 5.3 for UltraSPARC, and running the install took about 10 minutes and I was pleased to discover a fully operational desktop.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ccJ-BEaetio/UcVfn_Tni0I/AAAAAAAAAGw/dluZ9L8hfY8/s1600/IMG_00000267.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ccJ-BEaetio/UcVfn_Tni0I/AAAAAAAAAGw/dluZ9L8hfY8/s640/IMG_00000267.jpg" width="360" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">OpenBSD 5.3 running out of the box on a Sun Blade 100 UltraSPARC workstation</td></tr></tbody></table>These workstations were very useful in their day, and I am pleased to see that mine is still running. &nbsp;Performance is a little lower than I would like for some activities like browsing the web, but its actually perfectly acceptable as a development environment (and nicely free of distractions too).</div>
