<div class='post'>
So I am bringing my post-graduation sabbatical to an end and am now fully into the creation of my engineering career.<br /><br />I spent the past six months since graduation working in the construction industry with an awesome residential framing company known as LPT Construction.  The owner and manager has been really great to work for while I was working through school, and was totally willing to work around whatever crazy school schedule I had.<br /><br />I really have learned an enormous amount about construction, management, safety and productivity from the years of part and full time work in this industry.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am now really interested in starting my software engineering career; after all, I attained my degree for a reason right!<br /><br />Anyways, so I am available for hire!  If you want to take a look at my <a href="http://www.comlore.com/ted-bullock-resume.pdf" title="Resume for Ted Bullock">resume</a>, please have at it!<br /><br />-Ted</div>
