<div class='post'>
Ever since the speakers on my laptop decided to die, I have been looking for ways to get audio out of the machine.<br /><br />There are a couple options:<br /><ul><li>Don't have sound</li><li>Use headphones, or a speaker connected to the headphone port</li><li>Use a network sound server</li></ul>Given that I love the concept of tinkering around with weird technical thingamajigs, I decided to give the latter a try.<br /><br />So here is what I want to do.<br /><br />My mythtv frontend in the living room is connected to a very decent speaker system, also, there are other "always on" machines around the house which are hooked up to speakers.<br /><br />I want my laptop to auto-detect the existence of the sound systems on these machines and connect to them at a push of a button, then route all of my computers audio through those speakers.<br /><br />Anyways, I have not been able to get my laptops pulseaudio client to connect to a system wide instance running on the media server.  If anyone has gotten a similar system running, I would love to hear about it.<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
