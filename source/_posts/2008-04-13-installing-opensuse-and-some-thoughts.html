<div class='post'>
So I am just wrapping up my third opensuse 10.3 installation of the evening.<br /><br />Certainly the installation can take quite a while (about 2.5 hours for a GNOME desktop with along with updates).<br /><br />That is of course just for the base system.<br /><br />After that comes, the (inevitable?) binary nvidia driver, media codecs, dvd playback and then the various development tools that I use to do what I do (icc for example).<br /><br />This entire process wraps up in about 3.5 hours, and I have a working system that does pretty much everything that I could want a system to do.  Notably, this takes about 2-4 hours less to complete than a comparable installation of Windows XP.<br /><br />If the US would ever get its software patent nonsense in order we could finally see quicker and easier installs, and I would feel comfortable giving a disk to my parents with the expectation that they would be able to install a working system.<br /><br />For me, the biggest bug that I am running into is the lack of good built-in support for the nvidia cards that seem to proliferate my life.  This is one of the reasons that I am strongly considering diving into the nouveau project.<br /><br />Lastly, I just want to point out that I have absolutely no complaints with opensuse.  The project has been very good to me and my needs.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />-Ted</div>
