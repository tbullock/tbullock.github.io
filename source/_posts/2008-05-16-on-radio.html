On the Radio!<br /><br />Earlier this week, I was minding my own business, working away and listening to one of the periodical podcasts that pass through my filter of media to consume.<br /><br />The podcast in question is <a href="http://www.lugradio.org">LugRadio</a>, episode 100.<br /><br />At about the exact moment of 76:02 into the show, they started reading an email that I had mailed about a month ago.  Promptly, the guys made fun of my name, bemoaned my own bemoaning of linux support for the iriver clix (now resolved of course), and then congratulated me on a job well done.  I suppose.<br /><br />Anyways, I am glad to have made a difference, been laughed at, and been mentioned on the radio.  Who knew.<br /><br />As a side note, a passer by just noted that I am running openSUSE on my laptop.  Good for him.  Wooo community.<br /><br />Enough for now.</div>
