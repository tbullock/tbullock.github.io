At this moment, I am sitting in the secure boarding area of the Calgary International Airport awaiting my flight (connecting through Salt Lake City) to New York.  Thinking back on the week, this has been pretty interesting as far as these things go.<br /><br />I have several contracts running in parallel at the moment (a couple websites in addition to a couple more hardcore kernel projects).<br /><br />The most interesting (steepest learning curve) was setting up a VPN for a small carpentry business here in town.  Granted, I want to move away from the IT end of the software world, it was very interesting nevertheless. <br /><br />Anywho, we're now boarding so I am wrapping up.<br /><br />So long, and later :)</div>
