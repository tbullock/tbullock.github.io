<div class='post'>
I am thoroughly disappointed in the Gnome folks for posting a pic of the new time tracker applet in 2.28 with the title "Hamster".  Why should a project with that name be allowed into gnome proper.  That said I do quite like the applet.  I think.<br /><br />Anyways, the much anticipated Gnome 2.28 was released a while ago.  I have been running the development version of OpenSUSE for the past while, which has been more or less tracking the development of Gnome so by this point, all I have to say on the matter is, meh.<br /><br />It's a desktop environment, and for somethings it meets my needs, and for others, I couldn't care less.<br /><br />In unrelated news, I have recently filed a shwack of bugs against opensuse factory in an attempt to stabilize the desktop for myself.  I have not been terribly happy with the overall stability of the development versions of opensuse, and am constantly running into stability problems an a variety of quirks.<br /><br />That said, I am strongly considering moving to OpenBSD for precisely this reason.  While I like to be on the bleeding edge of things, I have had quite of enough actual bleeding thank you very much.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, hamsters should be shot, instability = bad, and my laptop is burning my tummy.</div>
