<div class='post'>
My laptop is in the process of updating to the latest Factory release of openSUSE 11.0.<br /><br />Certainly I have been hitting a couple major bugs:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=376742">Bug 376742</a> - Wireless doesn't work (wpa_supplicant doesn't get run)</li><br /><li><a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=343858">Bug 343858</a> - gdm packages downloaded with control-center upgrade use resolution specified for external monitor</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Since Alpha 2, I have been running the weekly (zypper update -t package).<br /><br />Certainly things are starting to stabilize now. For instance, I have no problem using the machine as a workstation.<br /><br />I have to say that the Dell 700m laptop is well supported along with a good portion of my other extraneous hardware, the majority of the core functionality works very very well.<br /><br />That said, I notice that Hibernate and Suspend/Resume used to work in SUSE Linux 10.1, it doesn't anymore.  I wonder if there is a way to revert to whatever mechanism was being used before...?<br /><br />Also, I am unsure if the SD Card reader works or not.  By working I mean, I plug an SD card into the onboard reader and a windows pops up in GNOME and asks what it should do with it.  I'll test this again tonight; I think that the last time I looked into this was back in the 10.2 days, so things may have changed since then.<br /><br />Next is the modem.  I have never been able to successfully establish a dial-up connection with the modem.  I am really not quite certain as to what the problem is.  Again, this will be something that I will test out tonight.<br /><br />I have also never tested the firewire port. Does anyone have a firewire external harddrive that they want to lend me?<br /><br />Hmm, the last thing is the microphone.  On the 700m there is a defect in the motherboard design that creates static on the microphone port.  I have tested this a couple of years ago with a Windows XP install.  There is certainly some sort of configuration problem with 11.0b1 and esd which won't let me turn on gnome-reclevel so I can't test this properly at the moment.<br /><br />Certainly I need to do some research into the new pulseaudio stuff.<br /><br />Meh.<br /><br />That's a problem for another day.<br /><br />Anyways, that's my experience with openSUSE 11.0 and my laptop.</div>
