As one of the rare users of a vanilla 386 computer, the news that <a href="http://marc.info/?m=118046279204104">the vanilla 386 will not be supported in future versions of openbsd</a> is somewhat sad but not unexpected.<br /><br />I have been very proud of my 386 (which I upgraded with a 387DX, 16MB of memory, a 4.3 gb hard disk as well as a collection network cards).  However, it's days with OpenBSD are now numbered to 154 (number of days until 4.2 is released).<br /><br />In the future I will migrate that particular machine to netbsd.<br /><br />Thought you should know.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
