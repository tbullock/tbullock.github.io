I'm not a security expert.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Well, let me say that I am the most technically skilled security expert that I know, however, I do not consider myself to be a security expert.&nbsp;My general approach to security is, turn off as much as possible, block everything except those few things I need and while I am at it, update everything to fix as many vulnerabilities as possible.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I am now administrating a server rack full of equipment running a slew of operating systems from linux to OpenBSD, to Windows Server 2003, 2008 and 2008 R2. &nbsp;Now there is nowhere nearly enough time in my day to audit these systems for&nbsp;vulnerabilities, and beyond running windows update, patching the linux/bsd machines, turning features off and putting a pf firewall in front of the entire rack, I am not certain what else I should be doing?</div><div><br /></div><div>I'd love some input here? If I were to spend a single hour tomorrow above and beyond my regular work securing the services, where would the best place to start be?</div></div>
