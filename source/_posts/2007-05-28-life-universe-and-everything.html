So now that I have finally graduated with my shiny new Software Engineering Bachelors degree, I supposedly have some spare time to work on my own projects.<br /><br />The first thing that I have done is rip out the old comlore web design business aspect of this website and replace it with a trusty blogger.com weblog.  The old business had its day in the sun, but I haven't actively worked on professional web design for a number of years now.  Moreover, the pages that used to be in this space were hardly well designed (I was 15 with only rudimentary understanding of web stuff at the time).<br /><br />Anyways, my list of personal projects is forever growing larger.  These primarily focus around two things at the moment:<br /><ol><br /><li>Open source development</li><br /><li>Website upkeep</li><br /></ol><br />Under first category, I am working on two important projects; <a href="http://www.comlore.com/httperf" title="httperf web workload generator documentation and resources">httperf</a> and a kernel space mtp driver for my iriver clix and other similar devices.  The work I am doing on httperf originated from my fourth year <strong>group</strong> engineering design project.  The work I am doing on the mtp driver comes from the time I spent working on the <a href="http://libmtp.sourceforge.net/" title="libmtp is an implementation of Microsoft's Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) in the form of a library suitable primarily for POSIX compliant operating systems.">user-space mtp driver libmtp</a> during my <strong>individual</strong> software engineering design project which also occured during my final year of school.<br /><br />The libmtp project suffers from some pretty substantial deficiencies with its dependency on the libusb library (e.g., device resource sharing is impossible between applications). and really needs to be re-written completely from scratch inside the open source kernel of your choice.<br /><br />The httperf tool also suffers from a couple deficiencies.  Primarily, it's current implementation is a little bit slow and it doesn't scale very well in testing extremely large web systems.  Currently, I am re-writing some of the core components of the tool to use the extremely spiffy libevent library.  I will never use select() again!<br /><br />Under my second category of personal projects are the maintenance of a number of webpages that I have written for various purposes over the past several years.<br /><br />The most important is currently my record of my <a href="http://www.comlore.com/bike" title="cross canada bicycle trip">cross country bicycle trip</a> in which I biked from Vancouver BC to St. Johns NFLD.<br /><br />The other major project, as well as something of a future career goal of mine is creation of a fairly comprehensive guide on how to <a href="http://www.createyourhomethreater.com" title="Guide on how to create and build your custom digital home theater">build your own home theatre</a>.<br /><br />On top of all that, I now supposedly need to maintain this here blog!<br /><br />Anywho, that is just about that for now.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
