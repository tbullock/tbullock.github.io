<div class='post'>
So the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Bug_Slashing" title="Portal to information regarding the opensuse bug triage weekend">opensuse bug slashing</a> weekend has wrapped up.  The original purpose of the exercise was to get a lot of community involvement into addressing persistent older defects in earlier editions of the distribution.  However, since the release of opensuse 10.3 beta 1 was on friday, the weekend also focused on testing.<br /><br />The builtin reporting abilities of bugzilla are unfortunately quite dismal so producing accurate reports on the number of bugs opened and closed is a little difficult.  However, I estimate that approximately 200 new bugs were filed, and about 160 were closed against all products since 10.0.  Pretty good if you ask me.<br /><br />Hopefully we can do this again before the release of 10.3.</div>
