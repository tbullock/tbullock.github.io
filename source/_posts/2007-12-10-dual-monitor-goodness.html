<div class='post'>
About 2 years ago I purchased two monitors for a dual monitor setup on my home workstation.  Unfortunately, I was thoroughly disgusted with the image quality of my mythtv system when I was using my traditional CRT as a monitor.  So I sacrificed my second monitor and have been using it as my television for the past long while.<br /><br />That all changed this week when I purchased a new 26" LCD television to use and the monitor for my mythtv media server.<br /><br />Now that I finally got my second monitor out of so called bondage, I took the time to configure a dual monitor setup on my main workstation.<br /><br />I was surprised at how straightforward this was with OpenSUSE 10.3.  Originally I had expected that I would need to do at least a little bit of manual configuration inside my xorg.conf.  Well, it turns out that dual monitors was far easier than I had expected and I am now working on httperf across the dual monitor set-up.<br /><br />As a side note, I am using an nvidia 7800GS with the proprietary driver.</div>
