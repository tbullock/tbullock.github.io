<div class='post'>
So I found myself an absolutely amazing engineering job!<br /><br />A couple weeks ago I had an interview with a company by the name of Rising Edge Engineering.  For those of you without an electrical background of sorts, a rising edge is the part of a digital electronic signal where the voltage rises from low to high, off to on, or 0 to 1.<br /><br />The interview was absolutely amazing.  The way that the conversation went was something like "I don't know how to do anything that you guys do!  And, I am absolutely committed to learning what it takes to do this".<br /><br />Their response was something along the lines of "Ooooo!  I want that!"<br /><br />So here I am, employed as an Engineer in Training in the discipline of Electrical Engineering for Rising Edge Engineering.<br /><br />Fun Hey!</div>
