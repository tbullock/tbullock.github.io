So I recently gave away my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iRiver-CXW-CRD-Wireless-Cradle-Speakers/dp/B000FOH2GG" title="iriver clix cradle">iriver clix cradle</a> because it was never really mine to begin with... Does that make sense?  Anyways, whatever.<br /><br />So last sunday I was moping around with no way to listen to music without an external set of speakers or headphones and feeling generally sorry for myself.  To rectify it, I hopped onto eBay to search for a new cradle to call my own. Sure enough, I found someone in Canada selling one of these rare beauties and put a bid down on it.  Not even a minute later, I discovered that this seller also had a matched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iRiver-AFT-200-Transmitter-Charger-Players/dp/B000FOC83S" title="iriver clix FM Transmitter">FM Transmitter (AFT-200)</a> up for auction as well. So I bid on it too!<br /><br />Anyways, a few minutes ago, they both arrived safe and sound, and now I am relaxing with blissful tinny (is this a word?) music echoing around my apartment.<br /><br />Thumbs up for the iriver clix, a great product.<br /><br />Thought you should know.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
