I recently got my nVidia dual-head <a href="http://www.pny.com/products/quadro/nvs/280NvsPciEx.asp">Quadro NVS 280 PCIe</a> graphics card functioning in openSUSE 11.0 with the open source <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/FrontPage">nouveau driver</a>!<br /><br />Originally I was inclined to use the proprietary nvidia driver since the nv driver does not support multi-head setups with my particular card.  However, the legacy nvidia driver is not functioning at the moment with the current kernel iteration of openSUSE 11.0.  So after a few hours of frustration, I blew away the proprietary driver and began work on installing nouveau.<br /><br />The binary version that is comes packaged for the distribution won't let me start X for some reason or another, and besides, I wanted to try out the latest and greatest developments towards the driver.<br /><br />Following the <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallNouveau">installation instructions</a> was straightforward after I installed the necessary devel packages that come with the distribution.  And within a few minutes I had a functioning desktop cloned across my two monitors.<br /><br />The next step was enabling telling randr to spread the desktop across both monitors, by folling the <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Randr12Howto">randr instructions</a> on the nouveau wiki.<br /><br />Clearing out a good bit of the autogenerated cruft from the <a href="http://www.comlore.com/xorg.conf">xorg.conf</a> file provided me finally with a functioning extended desktop.  All this with the open source driver, and a bit of perseverance.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.comlore.com/uploaded_images/nouveau-desktop-761016.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://www.comlore.com/uploaded_images/nouveau-desktop-760467.png" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Thanks to the folks on IRC!  Very helpful, and best wishes!<br /><br />-Ted</div>
