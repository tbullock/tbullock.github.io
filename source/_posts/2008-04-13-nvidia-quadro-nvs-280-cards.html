<div class='post'>
So I have recently purchased a number of <a href="http://www.pny.com/products/quadro/nvs/280Nvsagp.asp">PNY Quadro NVS 280</a> (nvidia) graphics cards across a variety of bus flavors.<br /><br />I have a number of thoughts regarding the cards. They support dual-DVI and are passively cooled.<br /><br />While they are certainly not very performant cards, they can reliably support any activity that a typical workstation would need to do.<br /><br />Besides keeping a number of the cards, for myself, I think I will forward a couple of them off to the nouveau project.  At some point in the near future I would love to be able to throw one of these cards into a machine of my choosing and have a 3d capable system at my finger tips.<br /><br />Lastly, since I own a number of nvidia cards anyways, I have been VERY strongly thinking of getting involved in the nouveau project myself.<br /><br />I will be moving later this summer to a place with a garage that I can certainly see converting into an open source development workshop.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
