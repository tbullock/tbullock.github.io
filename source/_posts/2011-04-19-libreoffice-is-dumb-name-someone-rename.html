I have been complaining that <a href="http://reverendted.wordpress.com/2006/09/08/dont-kill-the-penguin/#comment-1687">open source software suffers from dumb names for a while</a>. In fact, when I presented the httperf talk at WWW2007, the track officiator specifically mentioned that very blog post when he introduced me.<br /><br />So I can't help but feel squirmy whenever I hear or read the name LibreOffice.<br /><br />I think this is a dumb name; like really (OpenOffice.org is really dumb too)<br /><ul><li>Uses lingo which is never a good idea if you want to get beyond your grassroots (yay! marketing to myself, but not new people woooo!)<br /></li><li>Potentially hard to pronounce (needs a <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/faq/general-faq/how-do-you-pronounce-libreoffice/">page devoted to how pronounce it's name</a>)<br /></li><li>Doesn't roll off the tongue (see comments on recent <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/04/oracle-gives-up-on-ooo-after-community-forks-the-project.ars?comments=1#comments-bar">Oracle OpenOffice.org ArsTechnica article</a>)</li><li>There is a fair amount of <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=libreoffice%20name">dissent about the quality of the name</a>.</li><li>Many people <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=libreoffice+name+catchy">don't find the name LibreOffice catchy</a>, rather they find it difficult.</li></ul>That said, there is evidence that some people like the name, so either they are crazy and should be first up against the wall when the revolution comes or genuinely don't mind it.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm hung up on this. Seriously, I really am. I don't like it, and I want someone to make the effort to change it.</div>
