Well, I have been using the development versions of OpenSUSE 10.3 since alpha 5.  The operating system has certain stabilized quite a bit now at Beta 3.<br /><br />In one week (Sept 20) the first release candidate will be pushed out the door.  I am expecting only a few changes between now and then.<br /><br />One of the real big *Behind the Scenes* changes, has been with the package management system.  If you have been following the development of the OS since 10.1, you will surely have heard that there have been numerous complaints with the system.<br /><br />Primarily the complaints have been associated with the the integration of the red carpet technologies into the software management stack.<br /><br />Essentially in 10.1 and 10.2, there were two package managers.  The traditional yast stuff, and the newer red carpet stuff (zmd/rug).  I personally blame a lot of the problems on the necessity to synchronize (and failure thereof) between the two technologies.<br /><br />Anyways, with 10.3 looming in just under a month, the *new* package management stuff seems to have more or less hit its stride.<br /><br />ZMD has been removed from the OpenSUSE distribution and the old yast and red carpet packaging stacks can finally be said to have a full grown healthy child.  zypper. So far, I have no major complaints here at all, although some of the error messages are somewhat oblique.<br /><br />Also in the news is that the people at AMD have released a good chunk of the specifications for the ATI R500 graphics chips.  Currently the documentation (894 pages so far) mostly reflects the necessary information for implementing proper two dimensional support for applicable cards.  Supposedly, the three dimensional register information will be available some point next week.<br /><br />I am by no means an expert at graphics driver implementations, but from what I have read, this seems to be fairly promising.  One could certainly hope that it will be possible to make the applicable cards *<a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=114233317926101&amp;w=2">less evil</a>* as time moves along.<br /><br />Anyways, I won't be making any purchase in the graphics card domain for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Keep on swimming :)</div>
