As many people who follow what I do in the world know, I am a former cross Canadian cyclist and manage my own <a href="http://www.comlore.com/bike">personal website</a>  as well as a cool community project called <a href="http://www.wheelsinthewater.org/">Wheels in the Water</a>.  This summer I am planning my second tour of the country by bicycle.<br /><br />I am leaving from Horse Shoe Bay in Vancouver on June 3, 2009 and will be arriving at Cape Spear at noon on September 9, 2009.<br /><br />You will be able to follow along with everything between now and then via this blog, as well as my <a href="http://identi.ca/tbullock">identi.ca feed</a>.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
