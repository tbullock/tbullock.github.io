As I had mentioned in my earlier post about the re-organization of comlore.com, some people noticed that my old blog location (directly at comlore.com) was still available, but just wasn't being updated with new posts.<br /><br />Problem is that those pages have been referenced by the search engines as well as a multitude of links scattered around the internet.  So for the time being I set up redirects to the equivalent pages on at the new location (tbullock.comlore.com).<br /><br />Anyways, the moral of the story is that the top level of comlore.com is going to remain as a redirect for the next couple of weeks until the majority of the traffic that was hitting my blog, shifts to this new location.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
