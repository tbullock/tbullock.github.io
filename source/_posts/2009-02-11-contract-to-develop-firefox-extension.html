<div class='post'>
I have wanted to be part of an open source software development business for a long time.  Ha.  I'm quite giddy right now, because I just happen to own one.<br /><br />I have a number of little development contracts out right now to develop a variety of tools, website extensions and generally muck about with technology.  What's really cool is that I am using exclusively open source tools and environments to do the work in.<br /><br />Ha, this great.<br /><br />So long, and later.</div>
