I called my mom today.<br /><br />Exciting news?&nbsp; Well what's most interesting is that I did it via freeswitch running on openbsd-current (2014-11-26).<br /><br />Lots of things to do still, like tidying up the make files, writing init scripts, writing the port make files and other techy things (hash tables).<br /><br />Testing testing testing as well.</div>
