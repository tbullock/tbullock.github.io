<div class='post'>
I have been seriously considering reducing the number of computers in my life.  In the good old days, I ran a fairly powerful Pentium 4 desktop for gaming and general computer work.  The machine is still my central desktop, but I have found that I rarely use it these days.  That said, I promised my brother that he can have the machine.<br /><br />I've been thinking about what I want to replace the desktop with, and the more I think about it, the more certain I am that I no longer really want a desktop.<br /><br />My laptop (Dell Inspiron 700m) performs the majority of the tasks that I need, has open source drivers for every piece of hardware on the machine and is also very easy to bring with me where ever I go.  And from personal experience, the machine is a spectacular conference laptop.  Avoiding the need synchronize the machines is very appealing.<br /><br />So. Is this the way I want to go?<br /><br />Maybe.<br /><br />For May, my plan is to pack up the desktop, give it to my brother, and see if just using the laptop works for me.  At the end of the month, I will review if this was a success or not and choose whether or not to buy a new desktop.</div>
