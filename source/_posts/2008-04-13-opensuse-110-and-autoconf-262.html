So autoconf 2.62 missed the boat just by a couple weeks to be included in openSUSE 11.0.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />I have been anticipating this release for quite a while now. 2.62 has a number of enhancements that affect what I do.<br /><br />openmp support, along with support additional tests for the c99 stuff are a couple changes that jump mind.<br /><br />hmmm<br /><br />Anyways, I guess I'll be waiting for either SLED 11 or openSUSE 11.1.<br /><br />Sorry httperf, you'll have to make due with 2.61 for another release.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />hahaha<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />-Ted</div>
