About 6 months ago I purchased a reasonably cheap second hand <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Home.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodTypeId=12454&prodSeriesId=321968&lang=&cc=us">Compaq Evo D300 Small Form Factor PC</a>.<br /><br />Originally, the machine was intended to become a dial-up router and http proxy for my moms small gallery business in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress,_Alberta">Empress, Alberta</a>.  After repeated failed attempts to get OpenBSD to actually dial into the ISP, I gave up on that train of thought for the time being and brought the machine back to Calgary.<br /><br />Jumping forward a bit, I decided to start using the machine (named evo on my network) as my own gateway instead.  Fine.  OpenBSD installed just peachy, and configuring dhcpd and dns took a couple hours.  Poof, instant router.  However, one of the machines problems is that unless a keyboard is attached, it will fail to boot.  Despite all my rummaging through the bios, I was unable to turn off the darned "halt keyboard missing; Press F1 to continue error".<br /><br />This is a problem for server hardware which run headless (like a router should be able to), since if there is a power failure, I will need to manually hook up a monitor and keyboard, and press F1, and verify it is booting.  Gah, No thanks; I would rather run a crumby linksys.  Sure enough, Google came to my rescue.  Apparently, the ignore missing keyboard option is available on the machine, however, both a power and bios password need to configured to make it available in the BIOS.  <br /><br />Silly.<br /><br />That said, the machine is more than capable for a SOHO router, and now I am keeping it for myself.</div>
