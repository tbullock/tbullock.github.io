I wrote a WPF demonstration software for use with the Innovative Technology SMART Payout recently. I am available to provide software consulting services around this device and its cousin the SMART Hopper.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9vO0V0VgxTM/ToHkAM0Ao-I/AAAAAAAAABY/Y9XKrIbHIBg/s1600/SMART_Payout.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="219" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9vO0V0VgxTM/ToHkAM0Ao-I/AAAAAAAAABY/Y9XKrIbHIBg/s320/SMART_Payout.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Features:<br /><br /><ul><li>Recycling Bill Dispensor</li><li>12V powered</li><li>Removable Cashbox</li><li>Bunch of other stuff, see the site:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.innovative-technology.co.uk/index.php?option=com_displayproducts&amp;id=7&amp;view=single&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en">http://www.innovative-technology.co.uk/index.php?option=com_displayproducts&amp;id=7&amp;view=single&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en</a></li></ul><div>My software is a good demonstration of how to interact with the device.

Old comment, sorry.<br /><br />Ok, I&#39;m not sure how stable the device is in deployment.  My observations while developing against it weren&#39;t great though.<br /><br />Had some firmware issues though (couldn&#39;t get it to run on current firmware) end result of which was to revert to previous version.<br /><br />Support from the manufacturer was alright, I got an engineer to walk me through a variety of features on the phone with very little in the way of preliminaries.  Although it was a call to the UK which wasn&#39;t cheap.</div>

Oh sorry, haven&#39;t been watching for comments.<br /><br />Uh yeah, I might still have the code around somewhere.  I&#39;ll look.  Do you still need it?</div>

Is this device stable? I&#39;m developing app for NV200 Smart Payout and Smart Hopper in C# 4.0. <br />I noticed some problems with device or provided library.</div>
