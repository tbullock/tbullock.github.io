On June 30, 2008 I took possession of my very first property.  It&#8217;s an 800 square foot, two-bedroom condo in South Calgary (Alberta).<br /><br />Given that I am a massive geek, part of the renovations I am taking on in preparation for moving in, is a robust home network. This includes (at least) seven cat5e, and six rg6 cable drops.  For this I have used a fancy product by Leviton.  Their Structured Media center items appear to be exactly what I need to marshal my assorted cables, and send them along to their eventual end points.<br /><br />This allows a lot of flexibility towards future home renovations, and lets you easily re-design the layout of the network at a future point in time. As far as I am concerned, this sort of cable organization is the best way to go.<br /><br />In any case, all this work is being completed with the intention of designing an ideal open source home.  My routing, media distribution, work bench, telephony and data storage system have all marshaled into a single room.  The original analog telephony network is untouched in case a future owner doesn&#8217;t want to use the fancy system that I have built.<br /><br />Anyways, I have been doing this upgrade as part of a behind the scenes project that I have been playing with to develop a home running entirely on open source software.  More on this later, expect interesting developments as the year goes on.<br /><br />-Ted</div>

The glitzy look of the recent <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.jspa">IBM Lotus Symphony</a> release got my attention pretty quickly.  While trying it out on a couple of tasks I rather rapidly started hitting various bugs.  That said, I think the OpenOffice folks could take some hints in usability from this project.<br /><br />The biggest issue that I ran into was with Bold, or Heading text not showing up on a page.  Technically the the word processor thinks that the text is there because I can move my cursor through it, however it just shows up as white.  Closing and re-opening the document will show the text for a few moments, but it will disappear again pretty quickly.<br /><br />This is a deal breaker for me.  So I won&#8217;t be recommending it to anyone for the time being.  Too bad really.</div>

On the Radio!<br /><br />Earlier this week, I was minding my own business, working away and listening to one of the periodical podcasts that pass through my filter of media to consume.<br /><br />The podcast in question is <a href="http://www.lugradio.org">LugRadio</a>, episode 100.<br /><br />At about the exact moment of 76:02 into the show, they started reading an email that I had mailed about a month ago.  Promptly, the guys made fun of my name, bemoaned my own bemoaning of linux support for the iriver clix (now resolved of course), and then congratulated me on a job well done.  I suppose.<br /><br />Anyways, I am glad to have made a difference, been laughed at, and been mentioned on the radio.  Who knew.<br /><br />As a side note, a passer by just noted that I am running openSUSE on my laptop.  Good for him.  Wooo community.<br /><br />Enough for now.</div>

As good as OpenBSD has been as my gateway router OS, I am pretty sure that I am going to move away from it to one of the pre-packaged routing systems.<br /><br />Specifically, I am talking about <a href="http://www.pfsense.org" title="Open Source firewall distribution">pfSense</a>. pfSense is a distribution of FreeBSD that uses the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">pf packet filter</a> technology originally from OpenBSD, and actually had its origins as a fork of the <a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/">m0n0wall project</a> which uses ipfilter.  Both systems are extremely powerful, and importantly, easy for me to use, and because I want to stick with pf as my underlying packet filter, I have chosen pfSense.<br /><br />Installation onto my compact flash driven Compaq Evo D300 Small Form Factor, was very straightforward with the assistance of my card reader, dd, and a null-modem serial cable (after I figured out that installation is done via a serial terminal rather than the screen).  Certainly, anyone ready to do an embedded installation of pfsense just with parts lying around their house deserves major geek cred points.<br /><br />Right now, only 64Mb of the 2Gb flash card is partitioned for use (from the default image), which actually is not really a big deal since its a router. I&#8217;m not exactly going to mess with it very often.  Maybe.  I am forever tinkering with this stuff.  But I think that I will leave it until the next distribution update.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
About 6 months ago I purchased a reasonably cheap second hand <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Home.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodTypeId=12454&prodSeriesId=321968&lang=&cc=us">Compaq Evo D300 Small Form Factor PC</a>.<br /><br />Originally, the machine was intended to become a dial-up router and http proxy for my moms small gallery business in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress,_Alberta">Empress, Alberta</a>.  After repeated failed attempts to get OpenBSD to actually dial into the ISP, I gave up on that train of thought for the time being and brought the machine back to Calgary.<br /><br />Jumping forward a bit, I decided to start using the machine (named evo on my network) as my own gateway instead.  Fine.  OpenBSD installed just peachy, and configuring dhcpd and dns took a couple hours.  Poof, instant router.  However, one of the machines problems is that unless a keyboard is attached, it will fail to boot.  Despite all my rummaging through the bios, I was unable to turn off the darned &#8220;halt keyboard missing; Press F1 to continue error&#8221;.<br /><br />This is a problem for server hardware which run headless (like a router should be able to), since if there is a power failure, I will need to manually hook up a monitor and keyboard, and press F1, and verify it is booting.  Gah, No thanks; I would rather run a crumby linksys.  Sure enough, Google came to my rescue.  Apparently, the ignore missing keyboard option is available on the machine, however, both a power and bios password need to configured to make it available in the BIOS.  <br /><br />Silly.<br /><br />That said, the machine is more than capable for a SOHO router, and now I am keeping it for myself.</div>
