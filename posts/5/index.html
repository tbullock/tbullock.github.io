So February is rapidly drawing to a close and I figure I should make a note on the status of the various projects that I am working on.<br /><br />To start with, it is currently 3:30 AM and I am, for the fourth or fifth time this week trying to get firefox to install a file to an specific protected directory (system32 on windows XP and Vista). The problem is that firefox is specifically designed these days to block this kind of behavior (especially dealing with the whole UAC thing).<br /><br />Anywho, I am also managing a VPS transition for a small manufacturer here in Calgary. Lastly, I have 3 small contracts for web sites with various companies here in town.<br /><br />Not only that, but I am also working on my Landmark Introduction Leaders program, which takes it&#8217;s time.<br /><br />So lots of stuff going on at once.  Never mind working on httperf in the background too (only a couple dozen lines written since the beginning of the year).<br /><br />I feel that I want some minions.<br /><br />All in pursuit of having more freedom than I know what to do with.  (Hence the bike tour this summer).<br /><br />Later Alligator.<br /><br />-Ted Bullock</div>

As the title of the post indicates, I have been playing around with the gnome-do tool.  And so far I really do like it.<br /><br />For those people who aren&#8217;t familiar with the tool, it&#8217;s an application (written in mono I believe) with which translate fairly simple commands into a useful result.<br /><br />For instance, when I summon the gnome-do program and type tristan, I can either choose to start a chat with him or send an email.<br /><br />I especially like how I don&#8217;t particularly need to take my hands off the keyboard in order to do something on the graphical screen.<br /><br />So I removed the gnome menu from my desktop and will give &#8220;do&#8221; a whirl for the next month or so.<br /><br />-Ted</div>

I was just reading &#8220;Last Chance to See&#8221; by Douglas Adams.  Like most of his work, his writing once again proves to move almost orthogonally to the normal train of thought.<br /><br />For instance,<br /><br /><blockquote>Virtually everything we were told in Indonesia turned out not to be true, sometimes almost immediately.  The only exception to this was when we were told that something would happen immediately, in which case it turned out not to be true over an extended period of time.</blockquote><br /><br />RIP Douglas, you&#8217;re still in my heart.</div>

I have wanted to be part of an open source software development business for a long time.  Ha.  I&#8217;m quite giddy right now, because I just happen to own one.<br /><br />I have a number of little development contracts out right now to develop a variety of tools, website extensions and generally muck about with technology.  What&#8217;s really cool is that I am using exclusively open source tools and environments to do the work in.<br /><br />Ha, this great.<br /><br />So long, and later.</div>

At this moment, I am sitting in the secure boarding area of the Calgary International Airport awaiting my flight (connecting through Salt Lake City) to New York.  Thinking back on the week, this has been pretty interesting as far as these things go.<br /><br />I have several contracts running in parallel at the moment (a couple websites in addition to a couple more hardcore kernel projects).<br /><br />The most interesting (steepest learning curve) was setting up a VPN for a small carpentry business here in town.  Granted, I want to move away from the IT end of the software world, it was very interesting nevertheless. <br /><br />Anywho, we&#8217;re now boarding so I am wrapping up.<br /><br />So long, and later :)</div>

As I had mentioned in my earlier post about the re-organization of comlore.com, some people noticed that my old blog location (directly at comlore.com) was still available, but just wasn&#8217;t being updated with new posts.<br /><br />Problem is that those pages have been referenced by the search engines as well as a multitude of links scattered around the internet.  So for the time being I set up redirects to the equivalent pages on at the new location (tbullock.comlore.com).<br /><br />Anyways, the moral of the story is that the top level of comlore.com is going to remain as a redirect for the next couple of weeks until the majority of the traffic that was hitting my blog, shifts to this new location.<br /><br />-Ted</div>

Ever since the speakers on my laptop decided to die, I have been looking for ways to get audio out of the machine.<br /><br />There are a couple options:<br /><ul><li>Don&#8217;t have sound</li><li>Use headphones, or a speaker connected to the headphone port</li><li>Use a network sound server</li></ul>Given that I love the concept of tinkering around with weird technical thingamajigs, I decided to give the latter a try.<br /><br />So here is what I want to do.<br /><br />My mythtv frontend in the living room is connected to a very decent speaker system, also, there are other &#8220;always on&#8221; machines around the house which are hooked up to speakers.<br /><br />I want my laptop to auto-detect the existence of the sound systems on these machines and connect to them at a push of a button, then route all of my computers audio through those speakers.<br /><br />Anyways, I have not been able to get my laptops pulseaudio client to connect to a system wide instance running on the media server.  If anyone has gotten a similar system running, I would love to hear about it.<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />-Ted</div>

Last night I had one of those tinkering fits that occasionally over take me, and I updated my mythtv operating system to openSUSE 11.1.  Since there aren&#8217;t any really good instructions for this procedure (even the mythtv wiki is a bit stretched), I figured I&#8217;ll post my instructions here.<br /><br />My backend (and frontend) machine:<br /><ul><li>Pentium D 920</li><li>1Gb Ram</li><li>Hauppauge PVR-350</li><li>900 Gb  hardware RAID 5 (4 x 300 Gb) with Areca ARC-1210 controller</li><li>Geforce 7300 GS</li></ul>With the exception of the video, all the components in the machine here have good out of the box drivers.<br /><br />Anyways, I chose the basic X11 installation from the DVD, since I wanted to avoid installing too much extraneous software.<br /><br />The majority of the install is done from the command line so here goes (As best as I can remember):<br /><br /><pre>zypper ar http://packman.unixheads.org/suse/11.1<br />zypper install mythtv-backend mythtv-doc myththemes mysql<br />rcmysql start && mysqladmin -u root password mysecretpassword<br /><br />mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/doc/packages/mythtv-doc/database/mc.sql<br /><br />mysql -u root -p mythconverg<br />   grant all on mythconverg.* to mythtv@"%" identified by "mythtv";<br />   flush privileges;<br />   quit;<br /></pre><br /><br />Then with a running X session run the setup program, and there is plenty of documentation available for this on the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/User_Manual:Detailed_configuration_Backend">mythtv wiki</a><br /><br /><pre>mythtv-setup</pre><br /><br />Next I created a user &#8220;myth&#8221;, installed gdm, and configured the autologin, note that no password was set here for the user &#8220;myth&#8221; <br /><br /><pre>useradd myth -m<br />zypper install gdm<br />sed s/DISPLAYMANAGER="xdm"/DISPLAYMANAGER="gdm" /etc/sysconfig/displaymanager<br />sed s/DISPLAYMANAGER_AUTOLOGIN=""/DISPLAYMANAGER_AUTOLOGIN="myth" /etc/sysconfig/displaymanager<br /></pre><br /><br />Next I started yast and from the run level editor, I added both mythbackend and mysql to the start in run levels 3 and 5<br /><br />Finally to get the frontend to display upon boot I edited the file /home/myth/.dmrc to read<br /><br /><pre>[Desktop]<br />Session=mythTV</pre><br /><br />Restarted the machine to test all was well, and I was up and running.<br /><br />Not bad, as far as time goes either.  In total the installation took me about an hour and half.<br /><br />-Ted</div>

Generally speaking you want to look at using gdm or kdm for the auto login features when going for a mythtv install.<br><br>I have no idea whether or not XFCE has a login manager these days anyways&#8230;. hmm, certainly something to look up in due time<br><br>Anywho, you will need to install one or the other of the standard login managers.<br><br>As to your other question regarding the architecture thingy, I would personally go for 64bit on any machine that supports it.  I have no empirical rational behind this  but it really won&#39;t hurt.</div>

Oh, one other question?<br><br>If a system had an AMD BE2400 with 2GB RAM would you install the 32 or 64 bit version of OpenSuse 11.1?<br><br>Thanks</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I have been using my Dell 700m laptop as my primary computer for the best part of a year now.  And the machine is on borrowed time.  I think.<br /><br />Last year (2007, ack, that was two years ago&#8230;. anyways), I allowed the warranty to expire on the machine because I figured that since it had been so reliable in the past that I would probably be able to get away with it.  Well, that streak is now wearing to its end.<br /><br />And it&#8217;s the little things that are starting to go.  For instance, I am missing some of those little rubber feet on the bottom that prevent it from sliding around the desk.  Also, the battery life is serious diminishing, and barely lasts 30 minutes at this point.<br /><br />However, the most recent issue is that the speakers have cut out.  Turns out the the speaker wire that runs up through the hinge area has slowly been rubbing away over the past 5 years and has now been severed due to general wear and tear.  So no more speakers.<br /><br />Dell doesn&#8217;t sell the speaker individually either, they just come with an entire new lid (including monitor) for $550.  So, I have removed the speakers and will attempt to repair them at some point in the future.<br /><br />This is just indicative of what happens with laptops I suppose.  They get exposed to all sorts of little bumps, wiggles and jiggles in their lifetimes, and eventually little things wear away.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Lappy is on borrowed time, and sooner or later something vital is going to break, and there is no warranty left to deal with it.<br /><br />Anywho, the broken speakers thing got me interested in looking for a new machine, and the one I have come across seems to be fancy shmancy.  The dell Latitude E4200 is what I would call an &#8220;ultra-mobile workstation&#8221;.  Functionally it is more or less the same at the 700m for day to day laptop use.  The screen size is the same, graphics are still handled onboard, and the primary component manufacturer is still Intel (wooo, out of the box linux drivers).  Unlike the 700m, the E4200 can be used with Dell&#8217;s E-Series docking stations.<br /><br />I have never used a laptop with a docking station, because, for the most part, I couldn&#8217;t be bothered.  Why not just use a desktop.  But the new docks from dell support dual monitors, which is something that has really been missing for me.  Actually to be honest, I have dual monitor set-up sitting in my workshop, but they aren&#8217;t connected to a computer, they are just sitting there collecting dust.<br /><br />So I am rather tempted to hand lappy off to a deserving person and move to a shiny new computer.<br /><br />As I said, lappy is on borrowed time.<br /><br />Now if I only had a spare $4k.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
