  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
In my downtime, I have been spending a lot of time at the <a href="http://www.rmcr.ca/">Rocky Mountain Computer Repair Shop</a> here in Calgary, Alberta helping out with system tune-ups and general computer maintenance.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve encountered a huge variety of issues while working with the machines that come in, including virus removal, slow computers, broken installations of Norton, AVG, Internet Explorer, etc. Many of the problems are major nuisances to the owners and are caused by malfunctioning software or some sort of malware running on the system, other times the problems are caused by run of the mill user ineptitude.<br /><br />I am really good at getting systems working once they have been wacked by problems and can almost always actually fix the problem at hand rather than opt for the traditional orbital nuke of format/re-installation.<br /><br />That said there are some scenarios in which I recommend reinstalling Windows:<br /><ul><li>Want to migrate from 32-bit to a 64-bit installation (note that you would need a 64-bit installation media for this, the default recover partition/disks included on many OEM machines is not sufficient for this)</li><li>Want to start fresh with no OEM software installed</li><li>Have encountered a fundamental problem with your installation of Windows (rarer than many people actually think, but it can happen).</li><li>No service packs have been installed on Windows Vista.<br /></li></ul>Many manufacturers introduce an artificial upgrade ceiling on their customers by deploying 32-bit installations of Windows on 64-bit capable machines.  By doing this, it prevents customers from ever expanding the amount of installed, usable memory beyond the 4 GB (actually 3, or 3.5 GB) threshold. This is why many machines come from the factory with only 3 GB installed.<br /><br />Anyways, this article is not really about formatting and re-installing Windows which is a tiresome task without much challenge these days (except for tracking down drivers which can be very challenging sometimes).<br /><br />Rather this article is about how to actually go about tuning up a sick or slow computer.<br /><br />The very first thing to do before beginning a tune up is to ensure that the system is actually working properly.  It is very annoying to put hours of work into a computer and then discover that the problem was simply a dying hard drive.<br /><br />There are some things that die relatively regularly on a typical computer.<br /><ol><li>Power Supply (Incredibly Common)</li><li>Hard Drive (Incredibly Common)</li><li>Fans (Incredibly Common)<br /></li><li>Memory (Occasional, but at least it&#8217;s easy to address)</li><li>Motherboard (Usually a surface mounted chip, rather than the board itself)<br /></li></ol>So if a computer is turning itself is turning off all on it&#8217;s own the first places to check those noted above. Assuming that the computer turns on, it probably isn&#8217;t the Power Supply, so the next thing to do is run a hard drive diagnostic.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/downloads/seatools">Seatools</a> is a perfectly good Windows Application for diagnosing hard drive failures. Generally if the Short Self Test returns no problems then the drive is usually good to go. There may be filesystem issues though which may need to be examined.  Filesystem issues can be worked at by loaded a Windows Recovery Console and running the chkdsk utility.<br /><br />If a computer is failing to boot or having trouble reading data from the drive, even though the drive reports all is well in SeaTools, then consider running chksk /B {driveletter}: against the offending drive (if on Windows Vista or later) in the recovery console. Or chkdsk /F if  running on windows XP or earlier.<br /><br />Typically for filesystem issues, I will boot from a Windows 7 install/recovery disk and run the chkdsk utility from there seeing as Windows 7 has the latest NTFS code in it.  Checking Windows 7 NTFS partitions from XP will typically not work as the filesystem has been extended since XP was released.<br /><br />If the there are no filesystem errors, then checking the memory may be appropriate. Windows 7 has a built in memory checker which works well, however the tried and true <a href="http://www.memtest86.com/">memtest86+</a> works wonders as well.<br /><br />If everything is checking fine on the diagnostics it may be appropriate to examine the system physically. This can involve popping off a side panel on a desktop or disassembling a laptop (Which can be intimidating at first but isn&#8217;t nearly as hard as you might imagine).  Issues with fans running at full tilt are often caused by dust covering heat sinks (even in laptops, where this is really hard to check, and it&#8217;s best to just blast compressed air inside and see what comes out.<br /><br />Heat sinks may need to be reseated, which is done by completely removing all of the existing thermal compound from the contact surface of the heatsink and processor with a soft brush and rubbing alcohol,  and then applying a thin layer of thermal paste to the surface of the chip and the heat sink and rubbing it in so that it fills all the micro-grooves and grains of the surface and t then remounting the cooler.<br /><br />If there is stability issues, the last piece of hardware to examine is the motherboard (and occasionally the video card). It may be necessary to apply an update to the boards firmware using the manufacturers firmware update procedure.  Intel motherboards are a pleasure to update since that manufacturer provides update ISOs which can be burned and applied without an operating system install. Other manufacturers require the use of a dos boot disk which can be a challenge to acquire.<br /><br />So now that all the hardware issues are out of the way, the operating system itself needs to be examined.<br /><br />One of the first things to check is how up to date the installation is.  Windows XP should be at Service Pack 3, Vista at Service Pack 2 and 7 and Service Pack 1.  If the system is more than one Service Pack behind the state of the art, then I suggest formatting and re-installing with up to date media because waiting for updates to download and install will take FAR more time than cleanly installing an updated OS.<br /><br />If you don&#8217;t have up to date installation media, then you may be out of luck as far this goes, but these things can always be created using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipstream_%28computing%29">slipstreaming techniques</a>.<br /><br />If the machine just needs to be updated a bit, then by all means go about this. However if the computer is unbearably slow, the first thing to do may be to clean it up a bit.<br /><br />Download the <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner">CCleaner application</a> (and donate to the organization that makes it while you are at it. Use this application remove temporary cruft from the system, and then uninstall everything that doesn&#8217;t belong. Personally, if the machine is really slow and a memory upgrade isn&#8217;t in its future, consider removing the antivirus suite, as these applications have a tendancy to introduce a considerable amount of extra IO activity. When you are finished uninstalling all the toolbars and nonsense which doesn&#8217;t need to be there, work through the startup applications and remove as many as you would like.  Windows doesn&#8217;t actually need anything listed in the startup locations to boot and work properly so you can feel free to remove anything there.  That said, some applications are a good idea to keep running like the Java Update, Google Update and the adobe reader things  get reinstalled left-right and center anyways so you may as well leave them.<br /><br />Now restart the computer.<br /><br />It should already perform faster, and allow you to run the rest of your activities without fuss.<br /><br />Next examine the computer for software which should be updated and patched.  One of the best tools for this is the Secunia Personal Software Inspector, which is free for personal use. This application will scan the software installed on your computer and indicate to you that it should be updated.<br /><br />Follow it&#8217;s indications. No kidding.<br /><br />Anything that you cannot update, seriously consider uninstalling.<br /><br />Lastly consider which applications you are using to browse and interact with the Internet. For Windows XP, there is very little reason to be running Internet Explorer, rather any of the alternatives (Firefox, Chrome, Opera) are superior.<br /><br />Lastly examine the amount of system memory installed in the machine. Today, 4 GB of RAM is not inappropriate as the size of system applications and software requirements increases. Also, older desktops with onboard graphics can benefit greatly from discrete graphics solutions.<br /><br />Hopefully this article has been of use, let me know any of your suggestions in the comments.<br /><br />Take Care,<br /><br />Ted</div>

I&#39;ve been using different Windows operating systems and I find them easy to use. The only problem is they have a lot of software issues, especially Windows XP.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I was over at <a href="http://www.rmcr.ca">Rocky Mountain Computer Repair</a> last night looking over some of the dead machines that had been abandoned by their customers. Most machines were old and rather junky looking, but a few are in decent condition, except for the fact that they simply do not turn on at all.<div><br /></div><div>One laptop in particular wouldn&#8217;t post, and I figured it was either due for a motherboard replacement, or just maybe I would see something visibly wrong that I could repair. So an hour of disassembly, some fairly rigorous testing of potential faults, and I concluded that the motherboard was dead.</div><div><br /></div><div>This would usually be the moment to either abandon the machine or buy a replacement motherboard.  However, I have an engineering degree that has put me in a lot of deep contact with computers and I have learned some extra tricks as to what it takes to fix them that aren&#8217;t exactly in the manual.</div><div><br /></div><div>So here is the situation:</div><div><ul><li>An apparently completely intact  laptop computer will not post</li><li>No visible impact damage</li><li>No visible fire or heat damage</li><li>Functional and tested power supply</li><li>System starts to initialize but shuts down after 1 or 2 seconds, and before post</li><li>No audible alarms</li></ul><div>The laptop motherboard clearly had some function components, as it would attempt to start, however some pretty critical component needed early in the initialization process was not functioning, thus causing the machine to shut down.</div><div><br /></div><div>Given the symptoms, the most likely culprit was the nvidia northbridge or maybe the CPU. However since there were no alarms indicating a cpu or memory failure, the issue likely lay with the northbridge which is intricately involved with initializing both those systems.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>And how do you repair a northbridge?</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, you don&#8217;t.  If the chip is genuinely dead then there is nothing to be done and it is officially time for a new motherboard.  However, if the chip is still good (and there isn&#8217;t a really good way to diagnose this short of desoldering and testing in a laboratory setting), then the problem likely lies with the connections between the chip and the board. And perhaps those connections can be re-established by heating the board to a point near to the melting point of solder.</div><div><br /></div><div>So here is what we did:</div><div><ul><li>Removed all plastic and tape from the board</li><li>Wrapped board in tin-foil and placed foil padding against steel grate</li><li>Pre-Heated toaster oven to 385F</li><li>Placed board in oven </li><li>Chilled out for 6 minutes</li><li>Removed board from oven</li><li>Let it cool for 10 minutes</li><li>Installed CPU and Memory</li><li>Reconnected board to laptop power supply, power button and screen</li><li>Pushed the power button</li></ul><div>The board posted, and a moment later was complaining that it was missing an operating system and would we please give it back its hard drive. This process is known as reflowing, and although it won&#8217;t fix all similar issues it may just provide a solution to those in need.</div></div></div>

Yes, the oven rack.<br><br>Also, I should emphasize that we wrapped the board in tin-foil to reduce the probability of other chips being damaged.<br><br>we exposed only those chips we genuinely suspected.</div>

Hey Ted,<br>I have a board with the same issue. When you mention the steel grate, are you referring to just the oven rack?<br>Thanks<br>Bryan</div>

I own  and regularly use a Dell 700m laptop which I purchased in the first quarter of 2005.  From the factory the machine came with:<div><ul><li>512MB of PC2100</li><li>1.6 GHz Pentium M</li><li>5400 RPM 80GB hard disk</li><li>DVD-ROM/CDRW drive</li></ul><div>My then girlfriend borrowed the machine for a year and installed 2GB of RAM to assist with performance of a variety of applications.  This more than anything else has contributed to the machines longevity, and in fact I have now had the laptop for longer than that particular relationship lasted.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>In anycase, earlier this year I came into a license for Windows Vista and figured that perhaps I would see how it faired on the laptop.  And, for the most part it worked pretty well.  There are some graphical performance problems given that the 855GM driver does not support much beyond mode setting, and as a result the graphical capabilities are less than what is available on Windows XP or pretty much any other operating system.  However the machine has worked well for me all this time, although booting the machine took a fair amount of time</div><div><br /></div><div>Earlier this month I experienced a hard disk malfunction and was in the position of replacing the drive, replacing the laptop or going without.  After a goodly amount of humming and hawing over what to do, I decided that I would replace the hard disk.  However, I got carried away and bought myself a 64GB IDE SSD from Transcend.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes, I am completely aware that investing the $200 that I paid for the drive into a new laptop would have been a vastly more economical use of my money, however, I am sentimental and a tinkerer at heart and I want to be able to show off my old machine booting faster than many peoples brand new computers.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I purchased the SSD and installed it a couple days ago, and while I was at it I installed a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate that I got stuck with after one of my customers waffled on me.</div><div><br /></div><div>Low and behold, the OS installed just fine and recognized the Broadcom network adapter out of the box, from which I was able to run Windows Update and install the wireless network driver for the allegedly unsupported Intel 2915 802.11g wireless card.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then this morning I wrestled the video driver into place and achieved proper mode-setting.</div><div><br /></div><div>So what does this all mean?</div><div><br /></div><div>Well I can testify that I am running Windows 7 Ultimate on a Dell 700m with only one outstanding driver problem which applies to my never used SD card reader.</div></div>

hi I have that same dell and I too have had since 05 , it has not been used much for a few years and the SO keeps telling me to get rid of it as it collects dust on the desk , but I too liked it , nice size and feel and am going to install Linux on it and I wonder if an SSD would work for me ? <br />did you notice much of a speed upside ?<br />also the new SSDs are all SATAs it may be hard to find an IDE variety ??<br />thanks Ben</div>

As you may or may not know, I attended the CoApp Design &amp; Development Summit in Bellevue, Washington.

I have begun work on the Common Opensource Application Publishing Platform or CoApp.<br /><br />Before I get too carried away, I&#8217;ll say a few words about CoApp and why it is important.  First, there is a figurative mountain of Open Source Software out there in the world.  On a day to day basis we interact with some of it in applications like Firefox, Thunderbird, Google Chrome. In many situations, the OSS is hidden underneath a commercial application.  For instance, WinAmp, Lotus Symphony and others certainly fit into this category.<br /><br />So many of us are already using open source software on a regular basis and many times we aren&#8217;t even aware of it.<br /><br />However, if you ever take the moment to use a Linux desktop computer or a recent version of Solaris, you will know that there is much more os software &#8220;out there&#8221; than is currently available on the typical windows desktop computer.<br /><br />There are number of reasons for this, and Elizabeth Marie Smith gave a couple not too long ago<br /><br /><blockquote>Projects who don&#8217;t care.<br />Projects who don&#8217;t have the developers who know Windows.<br />Projects who don&#8217;t have the tools to develop for Windows.<br />Or don&#8217;t want to learn the windows API - who expect windows to work  exactly like unix or linux<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I would personally like to add one more to this list<br /><br /><blockquote>It&#8217;s really hard</blockquote><br />When it comes down to it, bringing an the typical OSS application to windows requires an enormous amount of cajoling and sometimes magic.  For instance, if you want a headache, look at what it takes to bring something a straight forward as the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Windows">gedit text editor to windows</a>.<br /><br />The library dependencies are where we fall down.  Much of the software was written for the linux environment, and although it has been somewhat ported to work on windows, there is an awful long way to go.  Most of the libraries do not compile under Visual Studio C++ (the Windows native compiler for C/C++ ) without significant effort.<br /><br />This is where CoApp will step in; the project intends to produce tools which greatly ease the porting process, and to provide a software repository and package management system to install the dependencies as needed.<br /><br />Most importantly is the developer end of the story.<br /><br />CoApp will develop an extension to Visual Studio which which will allow developers to choose which open source dependencies they want to link to. On build time, these will be downloaded, and installed on the developers machine in a common reliable location and linked against the developers binary in a safe and redistributable fashion.</div>

I run a small computer and communications company, and most of my interactions with the world seem to go through email.  I arrange meetings, send documents, plan schedules, and sometimes even do some work.<br /><br /><div>Well, today I took a serious look at my inbox.  At 10:30 this morning I had 730 threads, many of which are just simple questions like &#8220;When can we meet?&#8221; to much more complicated conversations.  In those 730 threads were a total of 4,271 distinct emails.  Of those 4,271 emails were 306 unread emails that I simply never got to over the past 6 months, most of which I was not a direct participant in anyways.</div><div><br /></div><div>For some reason I decided that today was the day that I would deal with, read and otherwise handle everything that was left incomplete in my inbox, and by midnight I would have nothing left in it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Many emails, although they aren&#8217;t exactly junk, are no longer relevant.  For instance, a schedule someone sent me for November doesn&#8217;t have a lot of relevance to my life today.  So delete it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Delete it?</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes. Delete it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I know all about the wonders of archiving and the palaver about keeping things around &#8220;just in case&#8221;.  Well&#8230; my inbox is not a storage location.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I took anything with attachments that I felt I might need and saved the attachments to appropriate locations, and deleted the emails.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anything with &#8220;When will you be here&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there at 8:30&#8221; style of content got wiped.</div><div><br /></div><div>And anything that I have decided to just never handle also landed in the bin.</div><div><br /></div><div>And I wasn&#8217;t gentle, everything in the trash has been permanently shredded.</div><div><br /></div><div>And yes yes, I archived a couple things in out of the way places.</div><div><br /></div><div>So here we are, as I type this the clock just clicked past midnight and after a full day of managing my email I now have the following: 61 emails in 37 threads.</div><div><br /></div><div>Those 37 are the only things that I couldn&#8217;t just ignore, and I am now waiting for the other ends of those messages to get back to me.  ahhhh</div><div><br /></div><div>What a day, I feel like my eyes are bleeding.</div></div>

As an Ojibwa elder in her own right, my mother maintains a website relating to native art in Canada and the Ojibwa/Anishnabe culture. As an adept story teller, her website is a well crafted series of stories and histories so I suggest that you read what she has to say about herself and her life and the culture of our (hers and mine) mutual ancestors.<div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.native-art-in-canada.com">Nokomis, a Canadian Ojibwa native artist</a></div></div>

I am currently working on the windows port of the Volume Management application that has consumed my waking moments for the past several months.<br /><br />I wrote the application using GTK+ for a number reasons:<br /><ul><li>Wanted to learn GTK</li><li>Portabilty (Although a LOT of this is on my shoulders)</li><li>I wanted to learn to apply the Gnome HIG</li><li>I wanted to</li><li>I don&#8217;t want to write it in </li><li>Because I can</li></ul><div>This is all well and good while running on my linux desktop, however, as I knew from the beginning, I would need to port the application over to Microsoft Windows.  Since I imagine that nearly ALL the target audience of this application uses Windows, this is REALLY important.</div><div><br /></div><div>To make this happen, I have written a decent initial implementation of the application for my linux desktop, copied it to the Windows partition and opened it up inside of Visual Studio (with nice project files and all).  Now comes the really quite hard part.</div><div><br /></div><div>GTK is not native to Windows.  So looking at the the <a href="http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html">GTK site</a>, it is moderately evident that one is expected to build their Windows apps from within a linux(y) environment via some sort of cross-compiler voodoo. </div><div><br /></div><div>Hmm, what to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>I happen to own a rather expensive license to Visual Studio 2005 Professional.  Shall I just leave it and head back to linux or, shall I try to get my program built against the mish-mash of binaries available from gtk.org or should I go for broke and setup a complete build system for all of GTK and its dependencies?</div><div><br /></div><div>Hmm&#8230;.</div><div><br /></div><div>A number of years ago I tried to do the whole dependency tree thing in an attempt to get FreeOrion built in Visual Studio.  A great deal of time later and I was never able to get a binary which would actually start.   Then again idea of compiling windows software in linux seems a bit silly, kind of in the realm of &#8220;just because you can does not mean you should&#8221;.  And this has me wondering about the quality of the binaries available at gtk.org, they are probably fine except I have no real auditing trail for their construction.</div><div><br /></div><div>So after an hour or so of deliberation, I have concluded that come hell or high water, I shall make my application run from the ground up building all the necessary binaries from scratch along the way. Visual Studio really shines here with built-in dependency management.  If I change a dependency, it triggers a rebuild of all the dependent components right the way up the tree.</div><div><br /></div><div>Next problem though is the compiler.  While the C++ compiler in Visual Studio is getting markedly better with each release, the C compiler is rather out of date and is likely going to remain this way for ever and ever.  Also the C runtime is currently missing a lot of the new goodness available these days.  For instance asprintf (which gets rid of a lot of head aches, especially when customizing SQL calls).</div><div><br /></div><div> The C runtime is something relatively easy to work with, as I can just create my own DLL of any missing functionality.  OpenBSD provides what I consider to be the most desirable implementations for this kind of stuff, so I have pulled strlcpy, strlcat, asprintf and others into what is now bsdc.dll</div><div><br /></div><div>And lastly is the compiler. I thought about this long and hard, and finally concluded that I really want to be able to use the latest innovations in C, so I bit the bullet and bought a license to the Intel C compiler.  The installation is easy and switching compilers is straightforward from inside the IDE.</div><div><br /></div><div>Assembling the project is nearly 50% complete at the time of this writing, and I will post with an update as to how it all goes together when I get my app finally running.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also I will publish the build environment when it is ready as well in case there is anyone else out there who wants to do the same thing (inkscape? pidgin? evince? gedit?).  It would really be nice to have a serious development environment available for this kind of thing.</div></div>
