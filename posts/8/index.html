If you are one of many people or organizations in Canada which use Telus for your domain hosting provider and are interested in moving your email system to google apps gmail service, then you make note of the following.<br /><br />Even after correctly setting up the MX service inside of the telus DNS web applet, you will need to give a call to Telus themselves and ask them to remove your domain from telus&#8217; internal sendmail list so that other people still using telus for the their email service will be able to send you emails.<br /><br />Otherwise what happens is that when someone using the telus email system tries to email you, telus thinks that it already knows how to get ahold of you and sends the mail internally instead of properly resolving the the DNS information.  Many emails will effectively disappear, or be bounced back noting that the user cannot be found.<br /><br />You may as well ask for the shared hosting support number right off the bat, otherwise you may be explaining all this to deaf ears any number of times until you get someone who knows what you&#8217;re gibbering about.<br /><br />Please enjoy responsibly</div>

I noticed that I have a couple of dozen visitors hit my earlier posting on synchronizing linux systems with a nokia 6301, and given that I am on a bit of high after just posting my previous note about connecting to the net through the the GPRS and bluetooth functions on the nokia 6301 I figure I will follow with my latest discoveries fiddling fun.<br /><br />I must be turning into a google zealot because everytime I turn around there is another google service available which I want to twiddle.  Let me explain.<br /><br />Currently Evolution does not support synchronizing itself in any sane fashion against a syncml device like the nokia 6301.  So all my contacts living inside my client have become increasingly disconnected with the contacts listed with gmail and the contacts that I have on my cell phone.<br /><br />Obviously the context between these three application is somewhat different in each case.  Like I often want to be able to grab a map of my next intended target from the evolution address book, but rarely want to do this inside of gmail itself, and I usually cannot be bothered with any of that rigamarole on the cell phone.  Nevertheless, it would still be nice if they were synchronized.<br /><br />So here steps in google to the rescue with its online syncml service, along with <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/">instructions on how to configure</a> the sister device of the 6301 (6300 in this case) to use its service.  Note that the Nokia 6301 and 6300 are S40 series Symbian OS devices.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t go into the details of the configuration since they are adequately specified elsewhere, but figure I will get to the point, thanks google for providing a working sync service.<br /><br />Next I want to point out that gmail is available as a binary application on most recent nokia phones including the slightly older models such as the 6301.  As a side note, this works with Google Apps as well.<br /><br />Check out http://m.google.com for all the goodies, including google maps.<br /><br />Sigh, I can feel the tendrils of zealotness swirling around me&#8230;  Somebody kick me if I go too far.<br /><br />Anyways, while this isn&#8217;t exactly a Nokia 6301 and Linux article, the same results can be achieved, so I figure it is a good enough equivalent.</div>

Currently I am sitting in Austin&#8217;s Neighborhood Pub across the street from my little condominium here in Calgary, Alberta.  Although I can see a number of wireless networks in the area, none of them are unsecured and for their own reasons, the pub itself is not particularly interested in providing wireless connectivity to its patrons.<br /><br />So this leaves me with the need to be creative in how I connect to the internet.  What&#8217;s more, in a couple weeks I am leaving for my second major cross country bicycle tour of Canada, and will likely be more or less completely away from the gentle caress of the net for most of that time.<br /><br />Anyways, as I mentioned, I need to be creative with this whole connectivity thing, and my solution is via bluetooth, to route packets through my cell phone and connect to the net via the phones GPRS (and EGPRS in some areas) data connection.<br /><br />The thing that impressed me is that this technology is alreadly quite nicely supported in linux, albeit with a bit of work on the commandline (not much, just check out pand, bnep, and of course ifconfig and dhclient).  If you want some fairly superb documentation on this check out the bluetooth article gentoo wiki.<br /><br />I imagine that other operating systems like the BSD&#8217;s would support this as well, but I haven&#8217;t confirmed it.<br /><br />Congrats to the bluez folks for delivering a working network bluetooth stack for linux.<br /><br />As a side note from what I read on <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/dcbw/category/networkmanager/">Dan Williams&#8217; Blog</a>, this functionality will eventually make its way into network manager itself sometime around the release of 0.8.<br /><br />This makes me want to move to a phone that actually supports 3g data connections to make this all a bit faster than dialup&#8230; However, at this time there is nothing available on the market which will do everything I want from a phone (3G. UMA, Bluetooth and supports a native binary gmail application). My current Nokia 6301 does all of this except the 3G thing, so I am going to stick with it for the time being.<br /><br />Take Care, and hopefully I will post back here before I leave for my tour, but then again, even if I don&#8217;t then so be it, I will be able to post from the road.<br /><br />Please enjoy responsibly</div>

I have been accused of ignoring the fate of httperf recently.  hmmm.  Well, fair enough, it&#8217;s certainly been a while since I committed anything to the repository.<br /><br />That said, httperf has hardly left my thoughts.<br /><br />I am pretty familiar with the tool at this point, and to be quite honest I am more than a little bit frustrated with it&#8217;s design.  Take a look for yourself!  It&#8217;s got a quite a few weird design concepts built into it, include c-ized objects (come now&#8230;), an Any type (oh good), it&#8217;s own event loop implementation, it&#8217;s own timer implementation (which at least doesn&#8217;t leak memory since I re-wrote it) and it&#8217;s own http implementation.  It seems to come from an era before the advent of code re-use&#8230; (No offense to David Mosberger)<br /><br />That said, it does implement the workload generator aspect of it&#8217;s design quite elegantly.  Differentiating between sessions, connections and requests is quite a useful as well.<br /><br />Anyways, I have been busy recently ripping the guts out of httperf to the point where it is hardly recognizable any more.<br /><br />The event loop, timer and http implementations are going away javascript:void(0)in lieu of those built into libevent.  The core of httperf and the stats collection are moving to their own shared libraries, and the workload generators are each moving to distinct binary files.<br /><br />Sound good?</div>
