So I am just wrapping up my third opensuse 10.3 installation of the evening.<br /><br />Certainly the installation can take quite a while (about 2.5 hours for a GNOME desktop with along with updates).<br /><br />That is of course just for the base system.<br /><br />After that comes, the (inevitable?) binary nvidia driver, media codecs, dvd playback and then the various development tools that I use to do what I do (icc for example).<br /><br />This entire process wraps up in about 3.5 hours, and I have a working system that does pretty much everything that I could want a system to do.  Notably, this takes about 2-4 hours less to complete than a comparable installation of Windows XP.<br /><br />If the US would ever get its software patent nonsense in order we could finally see quicker and easier installs, and I would feel comfortable giving a disk to my parents with the expectation that they would be able to install a working system.<br /><br />For me, the biggest bug that I am running into is the lack of good built-in support for the nvidia cards that seem to proliferate my life.  This is one of the reasons that I am strongly considering diving into the nouveau project.<br /><br />Lastly, I just want to point out that I have absolutely no complaints with opensuse.  The project has been very good to me and my needs.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />-Ted</div>

So I am just sitting down for dinner in a local pizzeria with great expectations of enjoying a very scrumptious dinner for one.<br /><br />Being a complete nerd, I naturally have my laptop with me, and have connected to the restaurants wireless connection.  The fact that this situation is possible, really speaks to our ability to be communication.  Like really.<br /><br />Even 5 years ago, what I am doing right now, would have been relatively rare.  Now, however I am only one of several people in the restaurant playing with various wireless devices.<br /><br />Cool hey!<br /><br />Anyways, I just left my favorite computer store here in Calgary with three rather sexy video cards.<br /><br />The cards are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>PNY Low-Profile Quadro NVS 280 AGP with DMS-59 (Dual DVI-I)</li><br /><li>PNY Quadro NVS 280 PCIe with DMS-59</li><br /><li>Matrox G550 with DMS-59</li><br /></ul><br /><br />All the cards are passively cooled, and will find loving homes in the various re-incarnated computers that pass through my life.</div>

The <a href="http://www.ifolder.com">ifolder</a> project is a really interesting way of synchronizing data between users and locations.  I personally used the project for over a year against SuSE Linux 10.1.<br /><br />Back in 2006 I filed an <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=232984">enhancement request</a> for openSUSE 10.3 to include the open source ifolder server with the distribution.  There was fair degree of interest on the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2006-12/msg00403.html">mailing list</a>.<br /><br />To date, there has been no action by Novell to include this software with their open source distribution.  This is interesting because <span style="font-style:italic;">they wrote it in the first place</span>.  If I were a conspiracy theorist, I would think that they are holding it back from the open source community just so that their enterprise distribution (OES for example) would be more value added than their community distribution.<br /><br />Lucky thing I could care less about conspiracy theories.<br /><br />So Novell has not put more than a token response into this request since the original request was made. Indeed I have just spent the day on IRC (#openSUSE-factory) waiting for a response to this question.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll try to be on their next status meeting to pursue this further.</div>

So here at the new job with Rising Edge Engineering, I have been learning all about electrical drafting, document control and the meaning of life.<br /><br />One of things that I see that is missing in the open source universe is suitable open source drafting software.  Inkscape, and OpenOffice.org Draw are not designed for this stuff.  So is there anything out there that can be used for something resembling real drafting&#8230;?<br /><br />The other thing I see is missing is some sort of document control server that OO.o, inkscape, and other document apps can plug into to deal with revisions.  It would be great to set up something that sits on top of ssh that is designed to deal with the various intricacies of document management stuff.<br /><br />Really I want an end-to-end enterprise document creation/storage system.<br /><br />Any Takers?</div>

So I found myself an absolutely amazing engineering job!<br /><br />A couple weeks ago I had an interview with a company by the name of Rising Edge Engineering.  For those of you without an electrical background of sorts, a rising edge is the part of a digital electronic signal where the voltage rises from low to high, off to on, or 0 to 1.<br /><br />The interview was absolutely amazing.  The way that the conversation went was something like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to do anything that you guys do!  And, I am absolutely committed to learning what it takes to do this&#8221;.<br /><br />Their response was something along the lines of &#8220;Ooooo!  I want that!&#8221;<br /><br />So here I am, employed as an Engineer in Training in the discipline of Electrical Engineering for Rising Edge Engineering.<br /><br />Fun Hey!</div>

So I am bringing my post-graduation sabbatical to an end and am now fully into the creation of my engineering career.<br /><br />I spent the past six months since graduation working in the construction industry with an awesome residential framing company known as LPT Construction.  The owner and manager has been really great to work for while I was working through school, and was totally willing to work around whatever crazy school schedule I had.<br /><br />I really have learned an enormous amount about construction, management, safety and productivity from the years of part and full time work in this industry.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am now really interested in starting my software engineering career; after all, I attained my degree for a reason right!<br /><br />Anyways, so I am available for hire!

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
About 2 years ago I purchased two monitors for a dual monitor setup on my home workstation.  Unfortunately, I was thoroughly disgusted with the image quality of my mythtv system when I was using my traditional CRT as a monitor.  So I sacrificed my second monitor and have been using it as my television for the past long while.<br /><br />That all changed this week when I purchased a new 26&#8221; LCD television to use and the monitor for my mythtv media server.<br /><br />Now that I finally got my second monitor out of so called bondage, I took the time to configure a dual monitor setup on my main workstation.<br /><br />I was surprised at how straightforward this was with OpenSUSE 10.3.  Originally I had expected that I would need to do at least a little bit of manual configuration inside my xorg.conf.  Well, it turns out that dual monitors was far easier than I had expected and I am now working on httperf across the dual monitor set-up.<br /><br />As a side note, I am using an nvidia 7800GS with the proprietary driver.</div>

Well, I have been using the development versions of OpenSUSE 10.3 since alpha 5.  The operating system has certain stabilized quite a bit now at Beta 3.<br /><br />In one week (Sept 20) the first release candidate will be pushed out the door.  I am expecting only a few changes between now and then.<br /><br />One of the real big *Behind the Scenes* changes, has been with the package management system.  If you have been following the development of the OS since 10.1, you will surely have heard that there have been numerous complaints with the system.<br /><br />Primarily the complaints have been associated with the the integration of the red carpet technologies into the software management stack.<br /><br />Essentially in 10.1 and 10.2, there were two package managers.  The traditional yast stuff, and the newer red carpet stuff (zmd/rug).  I personally blame a lot of the problems on the necessity to synchronize (and failure thereof) between the two technologies.<br /><br />Anyways, with 10.3 looming in just under a month, the *new* package management stuff seems to have more or less hit its stride.<br /><br />ZMD has been removed from the OpenSUSE distribution and the old yast and red carpet packaging stacks can finally be said to have a full grown healthy child.  zypper. So far, I have no major complaints here at all, although some of the error messages are somewhat oblique.<br /><br />Also in the news is that the people at AMD have released a good chunk of the specifications for the ATI R500 graphics chips.  Currently the documentation (894 pages so far) mostly reflects the necessary information for implementing proper two dimensional support for applicable cards.  Supposedly, the three dimensional register information will be available some point next week.<br /><br />I am by no means an expert at graphics driver implementations, but from what I have read, this seems to be fairly promising.  One could certainly hope that it will be possible to make the applicable cards *<a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=114233317926101&amp;w=2">less evil</a>* as time moves along.<br /><br />Anyways, I won&#8217;t be making any purchase in the graphics card domain for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Keep on swimming :)</div>

I was recently passed a link as to <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Opensuse_10.3" title="Wiki page on mythTV setup instructions for OpenSUSE 10.3">how to install mythtv on OpenSUSE 10.3</a>.  As I migrate from my current SUSE Linux 10.1 setup to a shiny new 10.3 installation I will be submitting contributions to that page.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I had better migrate to the schedules direct tv listing service pretty quickly here because I only have scheduling information left for 3 more days&#8230; eep!<br /><br />-Ted</div>
