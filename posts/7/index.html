The glitzy look of the recent <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.jspa">IBM Lotus Symphony</a> release got my attention pretty quickly.  While trying it out on a couple of tasks I rather rapidly started hitting various bugs.  That said, I think the OpenOffice folks could take some hints in usability from this project.<br /><br />The biggest issue that I ran into was with Bold, or Heading text not showing up on a page.  Technically the the word processor thinks that the text is there because I can move my cursor through it, however it just shows up as white.  Closing and re-opening the document will show the text for a few moments, but it will disappear again pretty quickly.<br /><br />This is a deal breaker for me.  So I won&#8217;t be recommending it to anyone for the time being.  Too bad really.</div>

On the Radio!<br /><br />Earlier this week, I was minding my own business, working away and listening to one of the periodical podcasts that pass through my filter of media to consume.<br /><br />The podcast in question is <a href="http://www.lugradio.org">LugRadio</a>, episode 100.<br /><br />At about the exact moment of 76:02 into the show, they started reading an email that I had mailed about a month ago.  Promptly, the guys made fun of my name, bemoaned my own bemoaning of linux support for the iriver clix (now resolved of course), and then congratulated me on a job well done.  I suppose.<br /><br />Anyways, I am glad to have made a difference, been laughed at, and been mentioned on the radio.  Who knew.<br /><br />As a side note, a passer by just noted that I am running openSUSE on my laptop.  Good for him.  Wooo community.<br /><br />Enough for now.</div>

As good as OpenBSD has been as my gateway router OS, I am pretty sure that I am going to move away from it to one of the pre-packaged routing systems.<br /><br />Specifically, I am talking about <a href="http://www.pfsense.org" title="Open Source firewall distribution">pfSense</a>. pfSense is a distribution of FreeBSD that uses the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">pf packet filter</a> technology originally from OpenBSD, and actually had its origins as a fork of the <a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/">m0n0wall project</a> which uses ipfilter.  Both systems are extremely powerful, and importantly, easy for me to use, and because I want to stick with pf as my underlying packet filter, I have chosen pfSense.<br /><br />Installation onto my compact flash driven Compaq Evo D300 Small Form Factor, was very straightforward with the assistance of my card reader, dd, and a null-modem serial cable (after I figured out that installation is done via a serial terminal rather than the screen).  Certainly, anyone ready to do an embedded installation of pfsense just with parts lying around their house deserves major geek cred points.<br /><br />Right now, only 64Mb of the 2Gb flash card is partitioned for use (from the default image), which actually is not really a big deal since its a router. I&#8217;m not exactly going to mess with it very often.  Maybe.  I am forever tinkering with this stuff.  But I think that I will leave it until the next distribution update.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
About 6 months ago I purchased a reasonably cheap second hand <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Home.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodTypeId=12454&prodSeriesId=321968&lang=&cc=us">Compaq Evo D300 Small Form Factor PC</a>.<br /><br />Originally, the machine was intended to become a dial-up router and http proxy for my moms small gallery business in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress,_Alberta">Empress, Alberta</a>.  After repeated failed attempts to get OpenBSD to actually dial into the ISP, I gave up on that train of thought for the time being and brought the machine back to Calgary.<br /><br />Jumping forward a bit, I decided to start using the machine (named evo on my network) as my own gateway instead.  Fine.  OpenBSD installed just peachy, and configuring dhcpd and dns took a couple hours.  Poof, instant router.  However, one of the machines problems is that unless a keyboard is attached, it will fail to boot.  Despite all my rummaging through the bios, I was unable to turn off the darned &#8220;halt keyboard missing; Press F1 to continue error&#8221;.<br /><br />This is a problem for server hardware which run headless (like a router should be able to), since if there is a power failure, I will need to manually hook up a monitor and keyboard, and press F1, and verify it is booting.  Gah, No thanks; I would rather run a crumby linksys.  Sure enough, Google came to my rescue.  Apparently, the ignore missing keyboard option is available on the machine, however, both a power and bios password need to configured to make it available in the BIOS.  <br /><br />Silly.<br /><br />That said, the machine is more than capable for a SOHO router, and now I am keeping it for myself.</div>

I have been seriously considering reducing the number of computers in my life.  In the good old days, I ran a fairly powerful Pentium 4 desktop for gaming and general computer work.  The machine is still my central desktop, but I have found that I rarely use it these days.  That said, I promised my brother that he can have the machine.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been thinking about what I want to replace the desktop with, and the more I think about it, the more certain I am that I no longer really want a desktop.<br /><br />My laptop (Dell Inspiron 700m) performs the majority of the tasks that I need, has open source drivers for every piece of hardware on the machine and is also very easy to bring with me where ever I go.  And from personal experience, the machine is a spectacular conference laptop.  Avoiding the need synchronize the machines is very appealing.<br /><br />So. Is this the way I want to go?<br /><br />Maybe.<br /><br />For May, my plan is to pack up the desktop, give it to my brother, and see if just using the laptop works for me.  At the end of the month, I will review if this was a success or not and choose whether or not to buy a new desktop.</div>

Although I haven&#8217;t done another major test run at openSUSE 11.0, I did have noticed that <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=343858">Bug 343858</a> (gdm packages downloaded with control-center upgrade use resolution specified for external monitor) is mostly fixed. I did hit the problem with maximized windows in metacity not filling the screen in certain circumstances.  All should be well on this front.<br /><br />Having xrandr extend my desktop to an external monitor is currently not possible without explicitly using the Virtual keyword in xorg.conf.  I filed <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=381765">bug 381765</a>, however the problem is apparently inherent with RANDR 1.2<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />I still have not grasped how the new pulseaudio stuff is supposed to let me record things from my microphone.  There are too many switches to play with for my emotional well-being (or something&#8230; Anyways I haven&#8217;t learned it yet).<br /><br />Testing a SD card in the 700m&#8217;s onboard reader was problematic.  An icon for the card flickered on and off the desktop about 100 times with lots of pop up windows trying to let me know of deep seeded grief, and checking dmesg shows numerous IO errors.  I have not filed a bug yet, but I will sometime this week.<br /><br />Anyways, it seems that the system is starting to now formally stabilize; and while this release won&#8217;t meet my every wim (working nouveau? autoconf 2.62? ifolder? bongo?), I will definitely be migrating most of my machines after the release.  Unless something dramatic occurs, the media server probably won&#8217;t change until support concludes from Novell for 10.3.<br /><br />More later.<br /><br />-Ted</div>

My laptop is in the process of updating to the latest Factory release of openSUSE 11.0.<br /><br />Certainly I have been hitting a couple major bugs:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=376742">Bug 376742</a> - Wireless doesn&#8217;t work (wpa_supplicant doesn&#8217;t get run)</li><br /><li><a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=343858">Bug 343858</a> - gdm packages downloaded with control-center upgrade use resolution specified for external monitor</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Since Alpha 2, I have been running the weekly (zypper update -t package).<br /><br />Certainly things are starting to stabilize now. For instance, I have no problem using the machine as a workstation.<br /><br />I have to say that the Dell 700m laptop is well supported along with a good portion of my other extraneous hardware, the majority of the core functionality works very very well.<br /><br />That said, I notice that Hibernate and Suspend/Resume used to work in SUSE Linux 10.1, it doesn&#8217;t anymore.  I wonder if there is a way to revert to whatever mechanism was being used before&#8230;?<br /><br />Also, I am unsure if the SD Card reader works or not.  By working I mean, I plug an SD card into the onboard reader and a windows pops up in GNOME and asks what it should do with it.  I&#8217;ll test this again tonight; I think that the last time I looked into this was back in the 10.2 days, so things may have changed since then.<br /><br />Next is the modem.  I have never been able to successfully establish a dial-up connection with the modem.  I am really not quite certain as to what the problem is.  Again, this will be something that I will test out tonight.<br /><br />I have also never tested the firewire port. Does anyone have a firewire external harddrive that they want to lend me?<br /><br />Hmm, the last thing is the microphone.  On the 700m there is a defect in the motherboard design that creates static on the microphone port.  I have tested this a couple of years ago with a Windows XP install.  There is certainly some sort of configuration problem with 11.0b1 and esd which won&#8217;t let me turn on gnome-reclevel so I can&#8217;t test this properly at the moment.<br /><br />Certainly I need to do some research into the new pulseaudio stuff.<br /><br />Meh.<br /><br />That&#8217;s a problem for another day.<br /><br />Anyways, that&#8217;s my experience with openSUSE 11.0 and my laptop.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
In reviewing some of the old yahoo/microsoft news clips of the past several months, I came across this note about <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/microsoft-yahoo-buyout,news-595.html">yahoo shareholders suing yahoo</a> for rejecting the initial Microsoft buyout deal.<br /><br />My thought is these guys are out of there minds if they think a Microsoft acquisition of Yahoo is good for them.<br /><br />I simply cannot see Microsoft being capable of stewarding a transition of this type in a way that would actually work.  Nevermind the completely divergent technology base and skill base.  If Microsoft feels they are not able to develop their Live platform to rule the day on it own, why should anyone trust them to steward the integration of a completely different platform?<br /><br />It&#8217;s not that I am against Microsoft here.  AND, I don&#8217;t get that they know what is missing with their own strategy to begin with. <br /><br />So I wonder what the Michigan’s Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System thinks they will get out of the Yahoo/Microsoft deal.</div>

So autoconf 2.62 missed the boat just by a couple weeks to be included in openSUSE 11.0.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />I have been anticipating this release for quite a while now. 2.62 has a number of enhancements that affect what I do.<br /><br />openmp support, along with support additional tests for the c99 stuff are a couple changes that jump mind.<br /><br />hmmm<br /><br />Anyways, I guess I&#8217;ll be waiting for either SLED 11 or openSUSE 11.1.<br /><br />Sorry httperf, you&#8217;ll have to make due with 2.61 for another release.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />hahaha<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />-Ted</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So I have recently purchased a number of <a href="http://www.pny.com/products/quadro/nvs/280Nvsagp.asp">PNY Quadro NVS 280</a> (nvidia) graphics cards across a variety of bus flavors.<br /><br />I have a number of thoughts regarding the cards. They support dual-DVI and are passively cooled.<br /><br />While they are certainly not very performant cards, they can reliably support any activity that a typical workstation would need to do.<br /><br />Besides keeping a number of the cards, for myself, I think I will forward a couple of them off to the nouveau project.  At some point in the near future I would love to be able to throw one of these cards into a machine of my choosing and have a 3d capable system at my finger tips.<br /><br />Lastly, since I own a number of nvidia cards anyways, I have been VERY strongly thinking of getting involved in the nouveau project myself.<br /><br />I will be moving later this summer to a place with a garage that I can certainly see converting into an open source development workshop.<br /><br />-Ted</div>
