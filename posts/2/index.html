  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Been a while since I posted. If you&#8217;re reading this post you, you probably came in from your  favourite search engine while searching for OpenBSD and FreeSWITCH.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.freeswitch.org/" target="_blank">FreeSWITCH</a> is a software voice switch which handles any manner of <a href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Specsheet" target="_blank">voice related activities</a>.<br /><br />These days <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_phone_calls_are_made_every_day_in_the_world" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">voice is pretty important</a>, and the backend infrastructure which implements it is in a decades long process of migrating from the traditional&nbsp; POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) to an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/01/the-telephone-network-is-obsolete-get-ready-for-the-all-ip-telco/" target="_blank">all IP phone system</a>. FreeSWITCH is definitely going to be on the platforms that ushers in the next generation of telecom. While I have some reservations about how the project is developed and maintained, it has a lot of things going for it like stability and a remarkable feature set.<br /><br />Using FreesSWITCH on OpenBSD might seem like a good idea seeing as how OpenBSD has the spectacular pf firewall, excellent security history and doesn&#8217;t move very far in weird and zany directions.<br /><br />FreeSWITCH on the other hand can&#8217;t seem to stop moving in weird and zany directions. They (even after moving to stable release tarballs) suggest that checking the source out from git is the best way to the most current and stable versions and don&#8217;t blink twice at dragging the entire source tree of their dependencies into their git repository. The FreeSWITCH developers attitude towards using system versions of their dependencies ranges from <a href="http://jira.freeswitch.org/browse/FS-353" target="_blank">aggressive no&#8217;s to rampant apathy</a>. I understand their reasoning (which is not exactly wrong), though for me this is pretty odd considering that pretty much every other major project doesn&#8217;t have this problem.<br /><br />So OpenBSD and FreeSWITCH&#8230; Where to start.<br /><br />At the time of writing there is no port of FreeSWITCH for OpenBSD, or any substantial package built for any major open source operating system.&nbsp; Nor is there likely to be without some serious effort. The only way to use the software is to jump though the git checkout hoops and run their gigantic build process through from start to finish (yawn). Debugging their build process on other operating systems than linux is a pain as well, given the dependency on stuff like gnu make, the position of the planets in the night sky and the inclusion of dependencies in their source tree.<br /><br />There have been thousands of hours of effort put into making those dependencies &#8216;work&#8217; properly on OpenBSD (nevermind all the other platforms out there). And replicating all that work into FreeSWITCH source tree just seems dumb and a waste of time (which it is).<br /><br />My proposed solution (and admittedly a work in progress without a finish line in sight) is the creation something along the lines of a shallow fork of upstream FreeSWITCH that could actually be used as an OpenBSD port.<br /><br />First order of business is the build system, and again since we&#8217;re talking about OpenBSD, I am not talking about using autoconf, gnu make, cmake, imake, scons, or any number of build suites. Really, I&#8217;m just talking about vanilla <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=make" target="_blank">OpenBSD make</a> (<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-users/2008/10/11/msg002183.html" target="_blank">here is an interesting thread on BSD Make</a>). Of course, use system libraries or existing tested ports wherever possible.&nbsp; The source tree should contain just those files actually needed for creating a bare installation<br /><br /><br />There are a long list of modules that also need porting, including some core requirements like mod_sofia.<br /><br />After that there needs to be some work done on things like moving configuration to /etc, logs to /var/log and various other activities consistent with making FreeSWITCH a valid citizen on OpenBSD. <br /><br />As I said, this is a work in progress, you can see the progress <a href="https://github.com/tbullock/freeswitch-openbsd" target="_blank">here on github</a>.</div>

However, one of her intentions for purchasing the content is to be able to consume it while in her vehicle. &nbsp;Unfortunately her vehicle does not include authorized audible decryption software, so it becomes necessary to convert the encrypted files to a format which the vehicle does comprehend (in this case MP3). In no way is this an illegal activity, nor should it be under any appropriate copyright law, however with the new digital lock provisions, doing this becomes illegal.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are a number of other consequences to the act that I am uncertain are covered by exemptions such as recovering installation keys to installed software products on Microsoft Windows and viewing encrypted content over an unsecured monitor.</div><div><br /></div><div>Effectively the law has the digital locking aspects backwards, where fair dealing with content should trump any locking provisions, not the other way around.</div></div>

Old comment, sorry.<br /><br />Ok, I&#39;m not sure how stable the device is in deployment.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of negative reviews and opinions about the Blackberry PlayBook and the future of RIM and I want to put my input in before things get out of hand.&nbsp;I own a PlayBook (really I do), and I read the reviews and general disrepute which people are holding RIM, and I don&#8217;t really get it. <br /><br />Many of the complaints about RIM are that they are behind the times with the deployment of messaging and contact software on the PlayBook. &nbsp;Obviously, this isn&#8217;t the case with their current mobile phones, where they dominate the mobile messaging market with their email and bbm.<br /><br />So, then what&#8217;s up with the PlayBook; how come to so many people they appear to be struggling (as reflected by their stock price, and the plethora of nasty comments by people on the Ars forums)?<br /><br />In the world right now we have a handful of mobile platforms to work with; Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nokia, Palm (HP) and RIM share almost the entirety of the mobile smart device market and with HP out and Nokia walking away from the software game with the recent deal with Microsoft, that leaves us with a grand total of four vendors supplying most of the worlds software platforms.<br /><br />When Apple released their tablet platform in 2010, it looked cool which had many people buy it, however, for many others, their was a major level of uncertainty as to how useful it would be to, you know, get something done. And of course, it&#8217;s not a good device to get something done on; the form factor is simply not conducive to actual real world work unless someone goes out of their way to write custom software which addresses the relevant silo (hence the app store). The iPad got&nbsp;relegated&nbsp;to the world of entertainment, which it appears to do well since people seem to enjoy movies and browsing the web and playing target games.<br /><br />Now, the real problem is that all that fun stuff goes only so far, and when it comes down to it, a $400 laptop is a heck of a lot more useful than a $600 tablet.<br /><br />And into this market comes the rest of the industry, which is super keen on exploiting and investigating this new form factor to see if any fortunes can be made; and of course they are running into the issues of usability, time to market and competition. The real fortunes in tablets might already have been made by Apple, and from now on the prices don&#8217;t have a heck of a lot to go except down.<br /><br />Now the rest of the industry has a couple options:<br /><br /><ol><li>Develop a new tablet platform from scratch (With plenty of time to do it right)</li><li>Develop a tablet platform from existing non-tablet technology (and hopefully do it right)</li><li>Adapt an existing handset platform for use on tablets (and maybe do it right, but end up with effectively the same product as any competitor which follows suit)</li><li>Don&#8217;t enter the tablet market</li></ol><div>When the iPad was originally released it was very clear that Apple had simply shoehorned the iPhone operating system onto a bigger device and called it the iPad, and the vast majority of the competitors looking in on that thought that would be a good idea to follow with the Android platform. So in short order the world was engulfed in tablet computers running handset operating systems.</div><div><br /></div><div>Undoubtedly RIM was looking at this situation, and it&#8217;s decision makers weighed the value of shoehorning their Blackberry OS onto a tablet like Apple and Google&#8217;s vendors have or jumping on the Google bandwagon and making yet another Android device. However RIM is different from every other current vendor in that they have an enormous investment and market share in their current technology platform (including BES, BBM and BIS email) and are obligated to support their existing customer base. In one weird sense, RIM is held back from just whipping up a hardware product and installing the latest head release of Android by the fact it has a reputation to uphold (I don&#8217;t believe RIM could have used Android as it&#8217;s tablet OS and maintained credibility).</div><div><br /></div><div>Moreover, when RIM examined its own software stack to see how it would fit onto a tablet, I am certain that key decision makers in the company saw (rightfully so too) that a handset platform is not a good fit for a tablet, especially if you actually want to get something done on it, and that an investment into a fresh design would be the only way to actually distinguish the product on the market in the long run.</div><div><br /></div><div>With that in mind RIM acquired the QNX platform for use on the PlayBook.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, out of the box QNX was not a tablet operating system, but neither was it burdened by years of specialization as a handset operating system. Pressured by time to market considerations, and the imminent depreciation of the entire tablet market with ever lowering prices RIM got a functional 1.0 release out the door by April of 2011. However, the product didn&#8217;t include direct support for existing RIM technologies likely because their simply wasn&#8217;t time to rewrite all the necessary software for the new operating system.</div><div><br /></div><div>That said, RIM did ensure that&nbsp;existing&nbsp;customers would be able to still use their BES, BBM and BIS email technology by using their existing fully featured blackberry handsets as a proxy for the service and writing thin clients on the PlayBook to interact with the handsets.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thus the PlayBook came to market.</div><div><br /></div><div>The criticisms that RIM has faced are that the the PlayBook doesn&#8217;t have a built in email client, messaging software, calendaring or contact manager. However it is important to note that, while this is true, RIM did manage to bring their product to market with support for their existing customers, even if the product didn&#8217;t have a great deal to attract new ones out of the gate. The promise being that since their is so much at stake for the company, that they will continue to support the PlayBook for the foreseeable future.</div><div><br /></div><div>Which brings us to the current date.</div><div><br /></div><div>Still unanswered is the actual real world usefulness of the tablet form factor. Data input via typing is painful, and will probably never be considered a strength of the form factor, however gestures and the multi-touch interface go an incredibly long way towards making the device usable, however, this is limited to only certain classes of software.</div><div><br /></div><div>The QNX platform though is quite advanced and likely offers the best long term software choice in the industry. The migration to the handset from the tablet will likely prove much easier in the long run than the reverse.</div><div><br /></div><div>Where the PlayBook really shines, and needs special attention is how it is used in a business context. The onboard HDMI port makes the device entirely usable for presentations, and with a little more work on the built-in powerpoint clone, this could be one of the main selling points of the device.</div><div><br /></div><div>Still missing is a robust way to share files with a standard desktop computer running Windows or other portable devices. &nbsp;The necessity to use BlackBerry Desktop Manager to sync and manage files on the PlayBook is completely untenable. MTP/Bluetooth, MTP/WIFI and standard MTP are how this should be done and RIM should know that by now.</div><div><br /></div><div>File format support should be expanded to include all the same formats as supported by the latest BlackBerry handsets. Notably missing are ogg vorbis and webm formats (in addition to a handful of others).</div><div><br /></div><div>The built in video conferencing software needs a great deal more attention. Support for interactions via Microsoft Lync, Skype, Jabber and SIP are critical to the business story of the device. &nbsp;Since a native full BBM client is imminent, I haven&#8217;t included it in this list.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fallback to a tethered handset data provider is not seamless, and appears&nbsp;inaccessible&nbsp;from some applications, notably the bundled mapping software.</div><div><br /></div><div>The developer story is poor. &nbsp;Really an add-in to visual studio is what is needed here with a preconfigured &#8216;run on&nbsp;simulated&nbsp;device&#8217;, &#8216;publish to hardware&#8217; and &#8216;submit to app world&#8217; with support for digital signatures out of the box.</div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;ll summarize this post with the following comments:</div><div><br /></div><div>I feel that the platform has a great deal of potential, especially with the imminent Android application software compatibility layer arriving in October and the rest of the basic messaging services like email and BBM arriving as full native clients. Since RIM is hardly going anywhere from the corporate point of view and QNX is the future of the company, owners can expect a long product life cycle which will probably only be matched by Microsoft with Windows 8.</div><div><br /></div><div>Shareholders should stop panicking, and running. &nbsp;RIM has done a good job with what they had available in front of them, had they taken any other actions, their credibility would have been worse off. Yes, it takes a while to do this kind of work properly, for hints at just how long, look at Microsoft (arguably the most&nbsp;capable&nbsp;software manufacturer in the world) and how much R&amp;D they are putting into the tablet user experience.</div><div><br /></div><div>RIM, the tablet needs more ongoing support for new features. Some of these I have already mentioned, however others are simple things like copy/paste, or more complex like messaging and notifications while &#8220;in-app&#8221;. &nbsp;Tile based window management would be a good feature to add, since the device already supports concurrent software.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, Good Luck and keep on swimming, Canadian high tech is depending on you.</div></div>

Nice article and I agree whole heartedly. I have been a &#39;bit&#39; of a Blackberry fan for four years now and have to listen the people beating it down in favour of the competition. Blackberry has a way to go to get themselves back to the fore in mobile technology, lets hope OS8 and beyond can do this.</div>

Ok,<br /><br />So this evening I finally to the time to complete the migration of my google apps account and the google account for my address (by far the most challenging migration in my entire company&#8230;. Sheesh)<br /><br />Anyway, this means that I can once again post to my blog!<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised by the new blogger interface which seems fun and cozy in tune with the facelift work that Google has been performing across all its services.</div>

Anyone who has tried to move Open Document Format (ODF) documents to Microsoft Office, has probably encountered fidelity problems. This is especially apparent when loading a *.ods spreadsheet in either MS Office 2007 SP2 or MS Office 2010.<br /><br />Formulas simply don&#8217;t get migrated over, and spreadsheets effectively turn into flat files when used in Excel.<br /><br />The fix for this will come with the arrival of functional ODF 1.2 import and export support.<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dmahugh/archive/2009/05/05/odf-spreadsheet-interoperability.aspx">Microsoft has obviously been aware of the problem for quite</a> a while, and while they are sympathetic, they haven&#8217;t yet released a fix to this problem and won&#8217;t until ODF 1.2 is finalized. This of course raises some interesting questions; like what degree of &#8220;finished&#8221; will be required before an implementation will be made available, and what software packages will receive support when it finally does become available.<br /><br />My hope is that Microsoft Office 2007 SP3 (if this is scheduled, 30 seconds on Google gave no hits yet) and Microsoft Office 2010 SP1 take serious stabs at implementing this, but for that to have any hope of happening the ODF 1.2 standard will need to be finalized &#8220;enough&#8221; for Microsoft to be willing to set it in stone (or easily malleable software, as the case may be).<br /><br />Recently (just last month), the <a href="http://www.opendocsociety.org/news/odf-tc-approves-odf-1.2">ODF TC approved ODF 1.2</a> as something known as a committee specification, which as I understand that OASIS rules means we&#8217;re nearing official OASIS blessing.<br /><br />So, will Microsoft consider this finalized &#8220;enough&#8221; to get their office suite ready to support it? We&#8217;ll see. I certainly can see their business case for holding off for something even &#8220;more&#8221; finalized like an ISO specification.<br /><br />A completed ODF implementation in MS Office is not exactly conducive to the long term market dominance of their office suite, and I would be willing to bet the longer they can hold off releasing an ODF 1.2 compatible implementation, the longer they will feel at ease with the proliferation of ODF centric office suites such as Lotus Symphony and the <a href="http://tbullock.comlore.com/2011/04/libreoffice-is-dumb-name-someone-rename.html">poorly named LibreOffice</a>. Competition will only really have a possibility of becoming fierce when documents can be tossed between office suites with little to no loss in fidelity.<br /><br />Anyway, the usability experience gap between Microsoft Office and it&#8217;s competitors is still so incredibly substantial (Although Lotus Symphony is very good), that I doubt the company needs to worry any time this decade. LibreOffice is no Firefox in my opinion.<br /><br />If I had to hazard a guess, I would bet that Microsoft Office 2007 will never get ODF 1.2 support, and that Microsoft Office 2010 will get it by Service Pack 2 in 2012 (or whenever it is released). Then again, maybe they&#8217;ll surprise me; maybe behind closed doors Microsoft has been readying ODF 1.2 support and is just awaiting OASIS certification.</div>

I have been complaining that <a href="http://reverendted.wordpress.com/2006/09/08/dont-kill-the-penguin/#comment-1687">open source software suffers from dumb names for a while</a>. In fact, when I presented the httperf talk at WWW2007, the track officiator specifically mentioned that very blog post when he introduced me.<br /><br />So I can&#8217;t help but feel squirmy whenever I hear or read the name LibreOffice.<br /><br />I think this is a dumb name; like really (OpenOffice.org is really dumb too)<br /><ul><li>Uses lingo which is never a good idea if you want to get beyond your grassroots (yay! marketing to myself, but not new people woooo!)<br /></li><li>Potentially hard to pronounce (needs a <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/faq/general-faq/how-do-you-pronounce-libreoffice/">page devoted to how pronounce it&#8217;s name</a>)<br /></li><li>Doesn&#8217;t roll off the tongue (see comments on recent <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/04/oracle-gives-up-on-ooo-after-community-forks-the-project.ars?comments=1#comments-bar">Oracle OpenOffice.org ArsTechnica article</a>)</li><li>There is a fair amount of <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=libreoffice%20name">dissent about the quality of the name</a>.</li><li>Many people <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=libreoffice+name+catchy">don&#8217;t find the name LibreOffice catchy</a>, rather they find it difficult.</li></ul>That said, there is evidence that some people like the name, so either they are crazy and should be first up against the wall when the revolution comes or genuinely don&#8217;t mind it.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#8217;m hung up on this. Seriously, I really am. I don&#8217;t like it, and I want someone to make the effort to change it.</div>
