I am thoroughly disappointed in the Gnome folks for posting a pic of the new time tracker applet in 2.28 with the title &#8220;Hamster&#8221;.  Why should a project with that name be allowed into gnome proper.  That said I do quite like the applet.  I think.<br /><br />Anyways, the much anticipated Gnome 2.28 was released a while ago.  I have been running the development version of OpenSUSE for the past while, which has been more or less tracking the development of Gnome so by this point, all I have to say on the matter is, meh.<br /><br />It&#8217;s a desktop environment, and for somethings it meets my needs, and for others, I couldn&#8217;t care less.<br /><br />In unrelated news, I have recently filed a shwack of bugs against opensuse factory in an attempt to stabilize the desktop for myself.  I have not been terribly happy with the overall stability of the development versions of opensuse, and am constantly running into stability problems an a variety of quirks.<br /><br />That said, I am strongly considering moving to OpenBSD for precisely this reason.  While I like to be on the bleeding edge of things, I have had quite of enough actual bleeding thank you very much.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, hamsters should be shot, instability = bad, and my laptop is burning my tummy.</div>

Well, here is the first time that I have done anything like this.  The latest milestone from OpenSUSE is broken.  Apparently they patched HAL with a crummy patch or something and now when you boot the OS hal crashes and you cannot access your mouse or keyboard while X is running&#8230;.<br /><br />Not the slickest thing that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Anyways, I booted to the commandline rather than start X and am posting this comment from the links browser.<br /><br />I couldn&#8217;t tell you if I like the experience, but it is definitely a first for me.<br /><br />Anyways, this is not meant to be a profound or indeed informative post, I just wanted to see if I could actually do it from the commandline line in text mode, and it turns out that I can.<br /><br />Now I am going to go to bed just because it is that time of day.<br /><br />So long.<br /><br />Ted</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So I have been having fun the past two days driving around Canyon Meadows (here in Calgary Alberta) with my GPS collecting information to post to Open Street Map.  Although I have used the GPS for most of the summer as I scooted across the country with my bike, I have not done much with it in terms of actual mapping.<br /><br />Now that I am officially back in town, I figure that a little bit of mapping would be fun to do, after all there is hordes of information missing even from the community within which I live.  So last night, one of my boarders and I hopped in the car and drove the alleys of NW Canyon Meadows.  I was slightly disappointed to discover that when I plugged the data in JOSM, the track was jagged and in areas, clearly wrong.  What could be the problem?  I have used this before to map the town of Empress Alberta without much difficulty.<br /><br />It occurred to me while lying in bed that maybe the problem had to do with where the GPS was stationed in the car.  On our midnight saunter, the gps was held in my passengers hand somewhere around or below his lap.  Could this cause the problem?  Maybe the unit needs better line of site to the satellites, and even the moderate amount of flesh and metal in the way was interfering with this.<br /><br />Perhaps this is bang on because I just got back from another little jaunt where I had the GPS sitting on the dash.  The result is considerably better and dramatically smoother.  So the moral of the story is that the best place for your GPS while in a car is somewhere near the dash or somewhere with more or less clear access to a large chunk of sky.  I suppose the more sky, the better.<br /><br />As a side note, the unit was reporting on average +- 3 m the second time around.</div>

I just spent a few minutes looking over the latest OpenOffice.org pile of poop included with opensuse 11.2 M6.  My goodness, this is a poorly thought out user interface design.  The application I am talking about particularly is writer.<br /><br />So I want to make a nice looking document with a decent title page and some nicely coloured headings all laid out with matching font choices.  I do not want to spend more than a minute or two thinking about these things either.  Please just make this the default.  I have to say I deeply prefer using the latest microsoft office compared to openoffice.  Document themes is a brilliant feature of office 2007 and it takes away the vast majority of mucking around that I have done with open office.<br /><br />To make a document in open office look pretty this the primary styles dialogue that you are given to work with:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_UwRf8HWneCo/SpuDzlFQttI/AAAAAAAAABY/5kHzWuKoo64/s1600-h/styles-and-formatting.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 261px; height: 400px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_UwRf8HWneCo/SpuDzlFQttI/AAAAAAAAABY/5kHzWuKoo64/s400/styles-and-formatting.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5376035502347564754" /></a><br /><br />Like seriously, what the hell is this.  What the hell am I supposed to do here?  Why am I shown this window, I can&#8217;t do a freaking thing with it?<br /><br />So I double click on the the first thing that jumps at me in the list, nothing happens&#8230; hmmm ok, so I right click on it and I am presented with a deeply useful menu saying two things<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>new&#8230;</li><br /><li>modify&#8230;</li><br /></ul><br /><br />I can figure out the &#8220;modify&#8230;&#8221; item, it probably modifies what ever the default is, but what the hell does new&#8230; mean?  Why are there trailing dots?  If I click new&#8230; does it make a new default?<br /><br />Anyways, I don&#8217;t want new things, I just want a pretty document, so I click modify with the hopes of encountering a switch somewhere which says enable pretty document.  No such luck.  I am presented with a second almost utterly useless window.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UwRf8HWneCo/SpuFuiohxkI/AAAAAAAAABg/moH2n1ZP5PU/s1600-h/paragraph-style.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 288px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UwRf8HWneCo/SpuFuiohxkI/AAAAAAAAABg/moH2n1ZP5PU/s400/paragraph-style.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5376037614814086722" /></a><br /><br />Now seriously, what the hell am I looking at here?  Look at all those damn tabs up there!<br /><br />Moral of the story is I really don&#8217;t like to use open office, it is effectively a poor clone of an older microsoft office in the ui realm.  Am I a microsoft guy? No. Have I hunted for things in their new ribbon layout thing? yes.  Their office suite does what I need of it and makes an honest attempt to get out of my way.</div>

If you are one of many people or organizations in Canada which use Telus for your domain hosting provider and are interested in moving your email system to google apps gmail service, then you make note of the following.<br /><br />Even after correctly setting up the MX service inside of the telus DNS web applet, you will need to give a call to Telus themselves and ask them to remove your domain from telus&#8217; internal sendmail list so that other people still using telus for the their email service will be able to send you emails.<br /><br />Otherwise what happens is that when someone using the telus email system tries to email you, telus thinks that it already knows how to get ahold of you and sends the mail internally instead of properly resolving the the DNS information.  Many emails will effectively disappear, or be bounced back noting that the user cannot be found.<br /><br />You may as well ask for the shared hosting support number right off the bat, otherwise you may be explaining all this to deaf ears any number of times until you get someone who knows what you&#8217;re gibbering about.<br /><br />Please enjoy responsibly</div>

I noticed that I have a couple of dozen visitors hit my earlier posting on synchronizing linux systems with a nokia 6301, and given that I am on a bit of high after just posting my previous note about connecting to the net through the the GPRS and bluetooth functions on the nokia 6301 I figure I will follow with my latest discoveries fiddling fun.<br /><br />I must be turning into a google zealot because everytime I turn around there is another google service available which I want to twiddle.  Let me explain.<br /><br />Currently Evolution does not support synchronizing itself in any sane fashion against a syncml device like the nokia 6301.  So all my contacts living inside my client have become increasingly disconnected with the contacts listed with gmail and the contacts that I have on my cell phone.<br /><br />Obviously the context between these three application is somewhat different in each case.  Like I often want to be able to grab a map of my next intended target from the evolution address book, but rarely want to do this inside of gmail itself, and I usually cannot be bothered with any of that rigamarole on the cell phone.  Nevertheless, it would still be nice if they were synchronized.<br /><br />So here steps in google to the rescue with its online syncml service, along with <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/">instructions on how to configure</a> the sister device of the 6301 (6300 in this case) to use its service.  Note that the Nokia 6301 and 6300 are S40 series Symbian OS devices.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t go into the details of the configuration since they are adequately specified elsewhere, but figure I will get to the point, thanks google for providing a working sync service.<br /><br />Next I want to point out that gmail is available as a binary application on most recent nokia phones including the slightly older models such as the 6301.  As a side note, this works with Google Apps as well.<br /><br />Check out http://m.google.com for all the goodies, including google maps.<br /><br />Sigh, I can feel the tendrils of zealotness swirling around me&#8230;  Somebody kick me if I go too far.<br /><br />Anyways, while this isn&#8217;t exactly a Nokia 6301 and Linux article, the same results can be achieved, so I figure it is a good enough equivalent.</div>

Currently I am sitting in Austin&#8217;s Neighborhood Pub across the street from my little condominium here in Calgary, Alberta.  Although I can see a number of wireless networks in the area, none of them are unsecured and for their own reasons, the pub itself is not particularly interested in providing wireless connectivity to its patrons.<br /><br />So this leaves me with the need to be creative in how I connect to the internet.  What&#8217;s more, in a couple weeks I am leaving for my second major cross country bicycle tour of Canada, and will likely be more or less completely away from the gentle caress of the net for most of that time.<br /><br />Anyways, as I mentioned, I need to be creative with this whole connectivity thing, and my solution is via bluetooth, to route packets through my cell phone and connect to the net via the phones GPRS (and EGPRS in some areas) data connection.<br /><br />The thing that impressed me is that this technology is alreadly quite nicely supported in linux, albeit with a bit of work on the commandline (not much, just check out pand, bnep, and of course ifconfig and dhclient).  If you want some fairly superb documentation on this check out the bluetooth article gentoo wiki.<br /><br />I imagine that other operating systems like the BSD&#8217;s would support this as well, but I haven&#8217;t confirmed it.<br /><br />Congrats to the bluez folks for delivering a working network bluetooth stack for linux.<br /><br />As a side note from what I read on <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/dcbw/category/networkmanager/">Dan Williams&#8217; Blog</a>, this functionality will eventually make its way into network manager itself sometime around the release of 0.8.<br /><br />This makes me want to move to a phone that actually supports 3g data connections to make this all a bit faster than dialup&#8230; However, at this time there is nothing available on the market which will do everything I want from a phone (3G. UMA, Bluetooth and supports a native binary gmail application). My current Nokia 6301 does all of this except the 3G thing, so I am going to stick with it for the time being.<br /><br />Take Care, and hopefully I will post back here before I leave for my tour, but then again, even if I don&#8217;t then so be it, I will be able to post from the road.<br /><br />Please enjoy responsibly</div>

I have been accused of ignoring the fate of httperf recently.  hmmm.  Well, fair enough, it&#8217;s certainly been a while since I committed anything to the repository.<br /><br />That said, httperf has hardly left my thoughts.<br /><br />I am pretty familiar with the tool at this point, and to be quite honest I am more than a little bit frustrated with it&#8217;s design.  Take a look for yourself!  It&#8217;s got a quite a few weird design concepts built into it, include c-ized objects (come now&#8230;), an Any type (oh good), it&#8217;s own event loop implementation, it&#8217;s own timer implementation (which at least doesn&#8217;t leak memory since I re-wrote it) and it&#8217;s own http implementation.  It seems to come from an era before the advent of code re-use&#8230; (No offense to David Mosberger)<br /><br />That said, it does implement the workload generator aspect of it&#8217;s design quite elegantly.  Differentiating between sessions, connections and requests is quite a useful as well.<br /><br />Anyways, I have been busy recently ripping the guts out of httperf to the point where it is hardly recognizable any more.<br /><br />The event loop, timer and http implementations are going away javascript:void(0)in lieu of those built into libevent.  The core of httperf and the stats collection are moving to their own shared libraries, and the workload generators are each moving to distinct binary files.<br /><br />Sound good?</div>

My friend Tristan and I have been fans of Master of Orion 2 for well over a decade at this point.  Personally, the game is within my top three all time favorite games (also including Crusaders of the Dark Savant and Close Combat 2).<br /><br />Anyways, a long time ago, we discovered that network multiplayer of MOO2 was deeply slow and sucky (like impossible to play for a protracted period of time).  The games we have played against one another have either been hotseat or deeply time consuming and resulting in no real conclusion.<br /><br />Well, no more.  I finally got off my butt in regards to this issue this week and managed to get MOO2 running quite nicely in Dosbox.  This resulted in us spending about 19 hours over the course of the last weekend playing the game the way it was meant to be played (to the bitter end of course, and several times over to boot)!<br /><br />Anywho, this worked so well, that I am currently writing an NSIS installer which will pull all the necessary components off of the install CD, as well as properly configure DOSBOX such that nobody else needs to go through the decade long pain in the ass that we went through ever again.<br /><br />Basically, what I have so far asks for the path to the install CD, copies the DOS only files to the HD, patches the game and sets up a local copy of dosbox to run it.<br /><br />Later I will write a launcher which will get the dosbox environment running in some sort of sanitized location and execute various cli switches to configure the gameplay itself.<br /><br />Weee!<br /><br />-Ted</div>
