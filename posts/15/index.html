So I have recently purchased a number of <a href="http://www.pny.com/products/quadro/nvs/280Nvsagp.asp">PNY Quadro NVS 280</a> (nvidia) graphics cards across a variety of bus flavors.<br /><br />I have a number of thoughts regarding the cards. They support dual-DVI and are passively cooled.<br /><br />While they are certainly not very performant cards, they can reliably support any activity that a typical workstation would need to do.<br /><br />Besides keeping a number of the cards, for myself, I think I will forward a couple of them off to the nouveau project.  At some point in the near future I would love to be able to throw one of these cards into a machine of my choosing and have a 3d capable system at my finger tips.<br /><br />Lastly, since I own a number of nvidia cards anyways, I have been VERY strongly thinking of getting involved in the nouveau project myself.<br /><br />I will be moving later this summer to a place with a garage that I can certainly see converting into an open source development workshop.<br /><br />-Ted</div>

So I am just wrapping up my third opensuse 10.3 installation of the evening.<br /><br />Certainly the installation can take quite a while (about 2.5 hours for a GNOME desktop with along with updates).<br /><br />That is of course just for the base system.<br /><br />After that comes, the (inevitable?) binary nvidia driver, media codecs, dvd playback and then the various development tools that I use to do what I do (icc for example).<br /><br />This entire process wraps up in about 3.5 hours, and I have a working system that does pretty much everything that I could want a system to do.  Notably, this takes about 2-4 hours less to complete than a comparable installation of Windows XP.<br /><br />If the US would ever get its software patent nonsense in order we could finally see quicker and easier installs, and I would feel comfortable giving a disk to my parents with the expectation that they would be able to install a working system.<br /><br />For me, the biggest bug that I am running into is the lack of good built-in support for the nvidia cards that seem to proliferate my life.  This is one of the reasons that I am strongly considering diving into the nouveau project.<br /><br />Lastly, I just want to point out that I have absolutely no complaints with opensuse.  The project has been very good to me and my needs.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />-Ted</div>

So I am just sitting down for dinner in a local pizzeria with great expectations of enjoying a very scrumptious dinner for one.<br /><br />Being a complete nerd, I naturally have my laptop with me, and have connected to the restaurants wireless connection.  The fact that this situation is possible, really speaks to our ability to be communication.  Like really.<br /><br />Even 5 years ago, what I am doing right now, would have been relatively rare.  Now, however I am only one of several people in the restaurant playing with various wireless devices.<br /><br />Cool hey!<br /><br />Anyways, I just left my favorite computer store here in Calgary with three rather sexy video cards.<br /><br />The cards are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>PNY Low-Profile Quadro NVS 280 AGP with DMS-59 (Dual DVI-I)</li><br /><li>PNY Quadro NVS 280 PCIe with DMS-59</li><br /><li>Matrox G550 with DMS-59</li><br /></ul><br /><br />All the cards are passively cooled, and will find loving homes in the various re-incarnated computers that pass through my life.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The <a href="http://www.ifolder.com">ifolder</a> project is a really interesting way of synchronizing data between users and locations.  I personally used the project for over a year against SuSE Linux 10.1.<br /><br />Back in 2006 I filed an <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=232984">enhancement request</a> for openSUSE 10.3 to include the open source ifolder server with the distribution.  There was fair degree of interest on the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2006-12/msg00403.html">mailing list</a>.<br /><br />To date, there has been no action by Novell to include this software with their open source distribution.  This is interesting because <span style="font-style:italic;">they wrote it in the first place</span>.  If I were a conspiracy theorist, I would think that they are holding it back from the open source community just so that their enterprise distribution (OES for example) would be more value added than their community distribution.<br /><br />Lucky thing I could care less about conspiracy theories.<br /><br />So Novell has not put more than a token response into this request since the original request was made. Indeed I have just spent the day on IRC (#openSUSE-factory) waiting for a response to this question.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll try to be on their next status meeting to pursue this further.</div>

So here at the new job with Rising Edge Engineering, I have been learning all about electrical drafting, document control and the meaning of life.<br /><br />One of things that I see that is missing in the open source universe is suitable open source drafting software.  Inkscape, and OpenOffice.org Draw are not designed for this stuff.  So is there anything out there that can be used for something resembling real drafting&#8230;?<br /><br />The other thing I see is missing is some sort of document control server that OO.o, inkscape, and other document apps can plug into to deal with revisions.  It would be great to set up something that sits on top of ssh that is designed to deal with the various intricacies of document management stuff.<br /><br />Really I want an end-to-end enterprise document creation/storage system.<br /><br />Any Takers?</div>
